BGD_RBE_TT_LONG: "§gA Resource-Based Economy is a proposed model for a socio-economic system. Its core idea is that all resources on Earth should be considered the common heritage of all humanity, managed, monitored, and distributed intelligently using the most advanced science and technology. Its ultimate goal is to directly meet the needs of all people, rather than operating through currency, credit, transactions, or any debt-based system.§!\n§gUnder such a system, money would no longer exist, as it is seen as the root cause of many problems like artificial scarcity, social stratification, conflict, and environmental destruction. Instead, decision-making would be based on the actual availability of resources, technological feasibility, and comprehensive consideration of ecological sustainability and human well-being. It envisions a global computerized system capable of tracking the Earth's resource reserves, environmental carrying capacity, status of production facilities, and the dynamic needs of the global population in real-time.§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_BGD_RBE_large\n\n\n\n\n\n£political_power_texticon Political Power Gain: §G+25.0%§!\n£consumer_goods_texticon Consumer Goods Output Modifier: §G-45.0%§!\n£prod_eff_output Production Efficiency Cap: §G+35.0%§!\n£dockyard_output_texticon Dockyard Output: §G+35.0%§!\n£construction_speed_texticon Construction Speed: §G+30.0%§!\n£research_speed_texticon Research Speed: §G+20.0%§!\n£manpower_texticon Weekly Manpower: §G+1500§!\n£construction_speed_building_texticon Building Construction Speed: §G+50.0%§!\n£resistance_texticon Resistance Target: §G-15.0%§!\n£stability_texticon Stability Modifier: §G+30.0%§!\n£war_support_texticon War Support Modifier: §G+20.0%§!"
