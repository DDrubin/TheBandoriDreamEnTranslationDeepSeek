BGD_zhixian_huiyi: "Constitutional Convention"
BGD_zhixian_huiyi_desc: "Finally, it is time to decide Japan's future destiny! Just thinking about its future is thrilling! But this Constitutional Convention is not just for us; our allies—the Japan Democratic Front—will also participate. These adults have been urging us to hand over power to them, as they do not believe a group of teenage girls has any experience in governing a country. But we will not give up; we will not abandon the opportunity to spread our dreams across the entire nation. This Constitutional Convention will be a grand assembly of compromise and博弈 (game-playing/strategizing) between both sides."
BGD_chongjian_weiyuanhui: "Establish National Reconstruction Committee"
BGD_chongjian_weiyuanhui_desc: "The war turned our former homes into ruins. The primary task of the new provisional government is to rebuild the nation. We will establish a 'National Reconstruction Committee' responsible for reconstruction work in various regions, winning the people's hearts."
BGD_zhenggui_minbing: "Formalize the Militia"
BGD_zhenggui_minbing_desc: "During the civil war, we relied on loyal militia forces to achieve victory. But in international conflicts,正规部队 (regular forces) are needed. Roselia and Raise A Suilen have proposed disbanding part of the militia and formalizing another part to better reach the '顶点' (summit/peak)."
BGD_xingzheng_gaige: "Administrative Reform"
BGD_xingzheng_gaige_desc: "The Glitter Party has a grand reform plan, and Arisa has worked herself to the bone to concretize Kasumi's 'Kira Kira Doki Doki' dream. This requires us to reform the old administrative system and establish a more efficient, more capable grassroots government that can execute our policies."
BGD_gaige_weiyuanhui: "Establish National Reform Committee"
BGD_gaige_weiyuanhui_desc: "To make the glittering dream a reality, all of Japan must undergo grand political and social reforms. We will establish a 'National Reform Committee' prepared to implement Glitter-ism reforms nationwide. This will be an immensely arduous and lengthy task, but for the dream, we fear nothing."
BGD_kuoda_shanyaodang: "Expand the Glitter Party"
BGD_kuoda_shanyaodang_desc: "Our large neighbor to the west, before becoming the totalitarian 'East Asian State,' once had the world's largest political party. Relying on a massive number of grassroots members, they ensured control at the local level and smoothly pushed through reforms. We should do the same: recruit more Glitter Party members. When our party organization spreads across the country, those parties in the parliament will be unable to compete with us."
BGD_kuoda_gongwuyuan: "Expand the Civil Service"
BGD_kuoda_gongwuyuan_desc: "Reforms are being rapidly promoted nationwide, but our government is short-handed. Expanding the civil service is crucial. Simultaneously, we will strengthen civil service training to create a large, professional civil service loyal to the cause of reform."
BGD_guoyouhua_chanye: "Wave of Nationalization"
BGD_guoyouhua_chanye_desc: "Implementing a certain degree of nationalization is one of the political consensuses we reached with the Democratic Front. We will evaluate all private财阀 (zaibatsu), large enterprises, and key industries, then nationalize them step by step. Of course, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not included; on the contrary, we will support the establishment of a capitalist economic system based on private SMEs, while the former zaibatsu, large enterprises, public sectors, and key industries will be state-owned. Achieving labor fairness in those private enterprises will require another method."
BGD_shehui_gaige: "Begin Social Reforms"
BGD_shehui_gaige_desc: "Implementing social reforms is an important step in our reform plan. We will bring a new breeze to society, remove the foul air of the past, and allow everyone to breathe freely and smoothly."
BGD_kuoda_baozhang: "Expand Social Security"
BGD_kuoda_baozhang_desc: "Japan is not heaven. Many people live in difficulty, and the civil war worsened this situation空前 (unprecedentedly). We will expand social security to ensure vulnerable groups are not left behind."
BGD_renxing_zibenzhuyi: "Capitalism with a Human Face"
BGD_renxing_zibenzhuyi_desc: "Black-hearted enterprises are a特色 (characteristic) of our country. Now we will no longer allow this situation to continue. Workplaces will be democratized; employees' opinions and votes will determine the operation and development of enterprises. Trade unions will firmly protect workers' interests. Our country will build a capitalism with a more human face. Enterprises violating labor laws will be heavily fined or even nationalized."
BGD_jiaqiang_jiaoyv: "Education is the Future"
BGD_jiaqiang_jiaoyv_desc: "Kasumi and the others are just recent graduates, so the Glitter Party深知 (is deeply aware of) the importance of education. Higher education nationwide will be subsidized—as long as you have the dream to冲击 (impact/enter) these institutions! Students will no longer need to attend school burdened by heavy loans. Simultaneously, compulsory education will be extended through high school. You ask where the money comes from?......"
BGD_zhengzhi_shehui: "Rectify Social Atmosphere"
BGD_zhengzhi_shehui_desc: "One恶劣影响 (pernicious effect) of the civil war was the rapid rise of yakuza forces in the power vacuum zones, while industries like the风俗业 (adult entertainment industry) expanded compared to before. This can no longer be tolerated. Classmate Hikawa Sayo is leading the national judicial organs; law enforcement will彻底粉碎 (thoroughly smash) these gangs and industries under our heavy blows!"
BGD_ziyou_pingdeng: "Beacon of Freedom and Equality"
BGD_ziyou_pingdeng_desc: "Under the dark cloud of the East Asian State's totalitarian threat, amidst global large-scale uninterrupted conflicts and wars, we must still坚守本心 (hold fast to our original intentions), overcome the fear of a dark and unknown future, and build our country into a free and equal society. Many more social reform items need to be put on the agenda; much leftover dross needs to be eliminated. Our country will ultimately become a beacon of freedom standing in the Pacific Ocean, shining brightly, providing the most crucial dreams and hope in the darkest times."
BGD_wenhua_qiangguo: "Cultural Powerhouse"
BGD_wenhua_qiangguo_desc: "Cultural prosperity is also one of the sources of a strong nation. Of course, cultural industries and entertainment activities will be important supporters of the new government. In the near future, perhaps just a few years later, people will have enough time to cultivate and develop their own healthy hobbies and interests. Cultural prosperity will allow our people to build the world's most civilized and prosperous nation—let's go on a nationwide tour!"
BGD_mengxiang_jihua: "National Dream Plan!"
BGD_mengxiang_jihua_desc: "It is because we had the Kira Kira Doki Doki dream that we embarked on this great journey. We should let every citizen have such a dream in their heart, let passion burn fiercely across the nation, never extinguishing. Have that mysterious guitar tour the country more; it will inspire the power in people's hearts.同时 (At the same time), cultural facilities will be expanded to encourage people to participate in national cultural activities. From early morning until late at night, there will always be people singing, painting, writing... everyone will do this."
BGD_wuzhi_chongshi: "Material Abundance"
BGD_wuzhi_chongshi_desc: "Only with full stomachs does one have the strength to pursue glittering dreams. The government has already done a lot to ensure citizens can pursue their own dreams无忧无虑 (free from worries). Now, the difficulty of people worrying about livelihood problems has lessened considerably. Finally, people have the opportunity to think about what their own dream is. But this is not enough. For everyone to live a materially abundant life and boldly chase their dreams, we still have much to do. Everyone, let's give it more effort!"
BGD_wenhua_dagexin: "Great Cultural Renewal"
BGD_wenhua_dagexin_desc: "Now, all of Japan is undergoing an unprecedented cultural renewal. The dross in culture is being discarded; people are becoming more confident, united, and互助 (mutually supportive). Almost everyone participates in cultural construction; everyone has their own hobbies and interests. We treat others sincerely; warm, kind feelings have replaced the past oppression. There is no bullying, no discrimination, only mutual aid and love. Our dream has come this far, and in the future, it will continue."
BGD_jianshe_dangpai: "Build the Glitter Party"
BGD_jianshe_dangpai_desc: "The Glitter Party embodies our wish to bring dreams and hope to this land. Therefore, building the Glitter Party more perfectly will allow us to realize this wish. We will further improve the political platform, rules and regulations, and organizational system. The situation in parliament urgently requires us to accomplish these tasks."
BGD_bufu_guomin: "A Party That Lives Up to National Expectations"
BGD_bufu_guomin_desc: "In the elections, people placed their hopes in us, giving us the chance to realize our dreams. We must not辜负 (betray) this expectation from the nation. The Glitter Party must undertake the tasks of grassroots construction and service. Glitter Party members will travel to every corner of the country, bringing the glittering dream to those neglected by society, helping those in need, and assisting our reform plans. Simultaneously, we will establish strict party discipline, expelling any member who violates rules,绝不容许 (absolutely not allowing) our pure dream to be亵渎 (defiled)."
BGD_xina_zuoyi: "Absorb Moderate Left Wing"
BGD_xina_zuoyi_desc: "There is still a considerable portion of the moderate left wing in the political arena, hesitating between us and the Democratic Front. The reform plan we are推行 (implementing) has begun to attract these moderates. We should make an extra effort, riding the east wind of reform to absorb them into our party.届时 (By then),一部分人 (a portion of people) within the Democratic Front will also defect, greatly weakening them."
BGD_qingxi_youyi: "Purge Ultra-Right Wing Militarist Remnants"
BGD_qingxi_youyi_desc: "Even now, those unyielding ultra-right wingers are still resisting, trying to破坏我们的梦想 (destroy our dream). This cannot continue! It was they who detonated the fierce civil war, nearly dragging our lives and dreams into the abyss. These ultra-right wing elements are the enemies of all who pursue freedom and peace! Since they deliberately seek to destroy everyone's dreams and freedom, then enemies of freedom shall not enjoy freedom. The government and law enforcement departments will strike hard against these ultra-right wing forces, restoring stability to society, leaving no place for the ultra-right wing to hide."
BGD_dapo_chuantong: "Break Traditional Politics"
BGD_dapo_chuantong_desc: "The Glitter Party will not be a party that conforms to the traditional Japanese political left-right spectrum. When the left-right struggle continued for decades without results, the nation yearned for new political solutions, and this will be brought by the Glitter Party. The various policies we implement are seen by some as left-wing and by others as right-wing, but all revolve around a main theme and core—establishing a society full of dreams and hope, with material abundance, citizens of极高素质 (extremely high quality), where everyone can and is willing to pursue their dreams.\n\nSuch a promise might seem unrealistic, but the mysterious guitar has given us the chance to realize the most impossible dream. Next, it's up to us to complete it."
BGD_zhanxin_daolu: "Pursue a New Path"
BGD_zhanxin_daolu_desc: "After确立 (establishing) our direction, the Glitter Party is striding大步向前 (forward in large steps) along the path to realizing the dream. Let us reassess various policies; as long as they help us achieve our dream, no matter what kind of policy, we will adopt and implement it. The Glitter Party will cut ties with our country's traditional left and right wings, free from the constraints and definitions of these old-school parties. Such a崭新道路 (brand new path) will be open, inclusive, full of vitality, an unconstrained, non-traditional political solution."
BGD_nianqing_zhichi: "Party of the Youth"
BGD_nianqing_zhichi_desc: "Due to its beautiful vision, radical reform policies, and development direction脱离传统政治 (divorced from traditional politics), the Glitter Party is gaining support from more and more young people. They are young people like us, yearning for unprecedented new changes. Gaining the support of young people in society shows we are a party full of vitality and youth, and will continue to change. Those roughly our same age will become the vanguard force of reform, assisting us in blowing the wind of reform across the nation."
BGD_guohui_gaige: "Initiate Parliamentary Reform"
BGD_guohui_gaige_desc: "With the collapse of the Democratic Front, finally implementing reform of the national political system is now without pressure and obstacles. This system born from compromise will soon change, and a new system will rise, representing the will of the people and ensuring the Glitter Party becomes the dominant force in the political arena, allowing reforms to be推行一路顺风 (implemented smoothly). And as Kasumi gradually matures politically, Arisa can finally feel at ease delegating power."
BGD_benxiang_mingri: "Rush Towards Tomorrow"
BGD_benxiang_mingri_desc: "Just thinking that more wonderful things will happen in the future makes us excited.永远保持希望 (Forever maintaining hope) has become the consensus of everyone on this land; never despairing in darkness is the people's spirit. We have finally come this far, and the future will always shine brightly—击穿你的梦想吧! (Pierce through your dream!)"
