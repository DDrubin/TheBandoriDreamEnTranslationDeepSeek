BGD_country_summary: "§YCountry Profile§!:\nJapan, the Land of the Rising Sun, is rising from the ashes after the baptism of fire from a brutal civil war. The stagnation and迷茫 (confusion) brought by the 'Lost Decades' have been彻底打破 (completely broken) by a group of girls carrying instruments with unimaginable determination and action. Toyama Kasumi and her leading Kira Party have established the new Japanese Free Republic under万众期盼 (the eager anticipation of the masses). The once highly anticipated yet uncertain 'Great Girl Band Era' has not been a flash in the pan but has instead transformed into a torrent reshaping the nation's destiny, leading this long-suffering island nation onto an unprecedented 'shining' path.\n\nThe newborn Japanese Free Republic implements a presidential system, with elected President Toyama Kasumi holding the highest executive, diplomatic, and defense powers, committed to building a nation that truly guarantees social freedom and individual civil rights. Under the leadership of the Kira Party, the state is vigorously promoting workplace-democratized welfare capitalism and ensuring political transparency through institutionalized democratic supervision. Its ultimate goal is to achieve a cultural utopia of material abundance, cultural prosperity, and equality and freedom for all—an ideal society reportedly backed by 'supernatural power' as a solid foundation.\n\nAlthough the wounds of civil war仍需时日抚平 (still need time to heal), and the construction of a new social order also faces重重挑战 (numerous challenges), the Japanese Free Republic has already shown the world蓬勃的生机 (vitality) and坚定的意志 (firm will). It actively advocates for and has formed the 'Asia-Pacific Free Nations Alliance,' attempting to spread this progressive ideology stemming from the pure dreams of girls. The former question of whether band girls could control their own destiny now has a resounding answer: they not only hold their future firmly but are also leading the entire nation towards a new era full of hope and infinite possibilities with their gentle yet resilient strength. This once silent nation is redefining its role and future on the world stage with a全新的姿态 (completely new posture).\n\n'On this reborn land, freedom and dreams will forever shine!'"

JAP_country_summary: "§YCountry Profile§!:\nJapan, the Land of the Rising Sun, lives up to its name. After its defeat in WWII, its economy hit rock bottom, becoming a poor and weak sunset nation. But within just a few years, it触底日升 (touched bottom and rose), even during the Cold War, its景气不断 (boom continued), performing miracles and rising straight to the top of Mt. Fuji. The good economic momentum allowed the already distinctive Japanese culture to develop磅礴 (tremendously). Tradition and new culture interwove, its吸引力 (appeal) radiating globally, its影响力 (influence) sweeping the world.\n\nIn twenty years, Japan would enter the new millennium in full victory. However, the sunrise must eventually set, miracles must one day end, and Japan is no exception. The bubble economy burst in 1985, ending the long-term economic prosperity. The era of stagnation, the 'Lost Decades,'揭幕 (commenced) and has now lasted thirty years. Of course, under the pressure of new changes, the Japanese people did not abandon themselves; like their ancestors, they chose to fight hard to the end.\n\nEven though衰颓不已 (in great decline), youthful vitality has never disappeared from this country. Toyama Kasumi and her friends and partners together ushered in the Great Girl Band Era—symbolizing that the young spirit of this country still exists, and positive, optimistic dreams have not vanished. Now, girls carrying instruments are随处可见 (seen everywhere) on the streets of Tokyo, bringing long-lost hope and dreams to Japan. But the天真乐观 (naively optimistic) girls did not realize while chasing their dreams that they were facing an uncertain future; their destiny and dreams were蒙上了一层阴影 (cast in shadow), seemingly注定 (destined) to be fragile flowers in a greenhouse. However, do not think they cannot control their own destiny; under crisis and heavy pressure, the band girls may display unprecedented vitality, showing the world a gentle yet坚韧不屈 (tenacious and unyielding) strength, proving they need no one's protection and are capable of gripping their own fate tightly in their hands. Will the Great Girl Band Era be just a flash in the pan, or will it bring profound changes to Japan and the world? We wait and see......\n\n'Everyone, let's shine and feel our hearts pound together!'"

The economic system is state-controlled, workplace-democratized, high-welfare state capitalism. The Kira Party defines itself as a civic party, focusing on争取支持 (gaining support) from the citizenry (especially the progressive citizenry), maintaining a middle path or centrism, while also having strong progressive colors, implementing progressive policies, and having significant populist characteristics. Therefore, the Kira Party is not a party leaning towards the radical left or right but attempts to break through the traditional left-right party categories, adopting various policies, attracting the people with a new political路线 (path) and political方案 (solutions).§!"

She is the indispensable organizational core of the band. The outbreak of the Japanese civil war and the social disorder, along with Kasumi's temporary depression, made Arisa feel anxious. Unlike Kasumi's emotional and idealistic nature, Arisa tends to冷静分析局势 (analyze the situation calmly), constantly thinking deep down about how to find a realistic and feasible way out for chaotic Japan,渴望 (longing) to restore order and peace.\n\nWhen Toyama Kasumi, encouraged by her companions, regained the 'Star's Pulse' and decided to投身 (throw herself into) the political movement, Arisa, though不免抱怨 (couldn't help complaining) about the arduousness of the plan, was also the first to看清 (see clearly) and决心 (resolve) to turn that ideal into a feasible blueprint. With her卓越的分析、规划与执行力 (excellent analysis, planning, and execution), she provided core intellectual support for the early formation and subsequent operation of the Kira Party, becoming Kasumi's most reliable 'Chief of Staff.'

EAS_riben_jingti_zhuyi: "Japanese Vigilance-ism" // Context suggests wariness/distrust of Japan
EAS_riben_jingti_zhuyi_desc: "In the official rhetoric of the Chinese Reconstruction Government and the Japanese government, the two countries have formed a deep friendship through jointly confronting and defeating East Asia Country (EAC - likely a stand-in for an antagonistic power) and are loyal allies and good friends to each other. However, within Chinese society, which has just been liberated from the totalitarian rule of the EAC, not everyone agrees with this statement. Many believe that the ambitions of the Japanese government are merely hidden beneath their表面上 (superficially) friendly rhetoric. Although Japan表面上 (superficially) maintains an equal relationship with China, they have indeed gained deep interference capabilities and strong influence over China's future destiny and path through defeating the EAC, and who knows what Japan intends to use these for? Perhaps to puppet and exploit China, just as they tried to do over eighty years ago.\n\nThis line of thinking affects a considerable number of Chinese people. The memory of the crimes Japan committed against China during the past century of national humiliation has not yet faded, and the relentless pursuit of independence and self-reliance over the seventy years since the new China's founding has been deeply engraved into the common memory and soul of the Chinese people. These two factors intertwine, influencing the Chinese view of Japan. For the Chinese people, even if Japan truly has no such ambitions, merely being an ally following behind Japan and accepting their influence and leadership is largely unacceptable. These thoughts undoubtedly stimulate Chinese nationalist sentiment.\n\nTo change these perceptions, Japan must do more to show sincerity and determination to the Chinese people. After all, Rome wasn't built in a day (literal: three feet of ice is not the result of one day's cold)."
EAS_zhongguo_chongjian: "China Reconstruction"
EAS_zhongguo_chongjian_desc: "After receiving righteous judgment from the Chinese people, the tyrants of the East Asia Country were all executed with extreme punishment; they will undoubtedly go to hell. However, this is nothing to be happy about. Those tyrants left behind a land of China in ruins. Families separated, cities collapsed, rural autonomy... Even now, the statistics on how many innocent people and coerced soldiers died under the brutal rule and flames of war are still being艰难地 (painstakingly) compiled. Even those who survived have to face the pain of losing loved ones and the extremely difficult living conditions; we are short of even the most basic living supplies. Economic and industrial production has completely collapsed, and food shortages have plunged our country into the risk of historical famine.\n\nHowever, the hardworking and brave Chinese people have never been defeated by similar difficulties. Since ancient times, we have faced so many desperate situations and survived by relying on our own courage and wisdom. This time is no different! The primary task of the newly reconstructed government is to mobilize the全国 (entire nation) to participate in reconstruction. We will rebuild our homeland brick by brick together with the people. With the people's incredibly strong perseverance and confidence, and with aid from Japan and various countries of the Asian Freedom Organization, we will surely be able to rebuild the motherland.\n\nWhen people are of one mind, they can move Mount Tai!"
EAS_lianhe_zhengfu: "Coalition Government with Divergent Agendas"
EAS_lianhe_zhengfu_desc: "After defeating the East Asia Country, the guerrilla fighters who resisted in the deep mountains and forests and the active members of the underground resistance organizations finally came before the people as heroes, receiving endless cheers. These guerrilla fighters and underground resistance members jointly formed a new government, also吸纳 (absorbing) those democrats who did not resist violently but also refused to cooperate with the former EAC government. A significant portion of the new government consists of guerrilla fighters, underground resistance members, and democrats who support KiraKiraDokiDoki-ism; they together established the Chinese KiraKiraDokiDoki Party. The new coalition government, with Japanese support, established a big tent ruling coalition led by the Chinese KiraKiraDokiDoki Party,包含 (including) various democratic parties, including the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nOn the surface, every party in this ruling coalition has sworn to work together to rebuild the motherland. However, beneath the atmosphere of harmony, each party actually has its own views on how China's future should proceed and intends to use this opportunity to govern and reshape China according to its own ideas. The KiraKiraDokiDoki Party, naturally with Japanese support, intends to implement the cultural utopian理念 (concept) of KiraKiraDokiDoki-ism, building China into a pure land of harmony and beauty. Although many people support them and Japan's success案例 (case study) serves as a guarantee, they still generally lack local support, and the public remains quite suspicious of this foreign ideology.\n\nThe CCP also led many people in actively participating in the guerrilla warfare and underground resistance movements against the EAC, which further significantly enhanced their prestige and status in the hearts of the people, giving them considerable地位 (status) and话语权 (voice) within the ruling coalition. Undoubtedly, their goal is naturally to return to the status of the sole ruling party with strong popular support. Many other democratic parties are also vying for public support, trying to use this opportunity to come to power and develop the country according to their own vision.\n\nThese divergent agendas cause serious internal consumption within the coalition government. Parties quarrel incessantly, policies and bills are difficult to pass, and the government's administrative capacity is大幅 (greatly) reduced. To solve this problem, we must wait until the national election after the reconstruction is completed to see who is favored by the people and can take charge of the政权 (regime), leading the future of this country."

These warlords have diverse ideologies and political systems, including those推崇 (advocating) self-destruction—clearly remnants of the EAC—as well as separatists and red warlords, and many warlords who have regressed to pre-modern ideologies. They remain hostile to each other, often engaging in small-scale conflicts, making life不安宁 (unpeaceful) for the people under their rule. It is unknown when large-scale warlord混战 (melee) might break out. If a large-scale melee真的 (truly) breaks out,同胞 (compatriots) there will likely suffer even more.\n\nAs the唯一合法 (sole legitimate) government of China, we cannot stand idly by and watch the suffering people and the横行无忌 (unscrupulous) warlords. We will win over some warlords who might be willing to unify peacefully, such as the red warlords. As for the remaining顽固派 (hardline) warlords, even though the country is still under reconstruction, we have already begun formulating plans to advance westward and整军备战 (prepare the army for war).
