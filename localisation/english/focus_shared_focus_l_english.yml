BGD_jianli_guofangjun: "Establish National Defense Force"
BGD_jianli_guofangjun_desc: "It is time to establish our country's regular army. The name of this new force will be the 'National Defense Force' (NDF for short), to reflect its deep connection with the people and our commitment to upholding peace and not initiating war.\n\nThe road ahead is long; to build a strong military and safeguard the nation's peace, we still have much to do."
BGD_yvsuan_qvshe: "Budget Trade-offs"
BGD_yvsuan_qvshe_desc: "Unfortunately, our military budget is limited, and post-civil war public calls for peace do not allow us to increase the budget unless the geopolitical situation changes. We must decide whether to primarily invest this budget in the army, navy, or air force. We need to plan ahead to prevent inter-service rivalry and conflict over funding, as seen during the old empire era."
BGD_guanbing_pingdeng: "Officer-Soldier Equality"
BGD_guanbing_pingdeng_desc: "In our military, there is only distinction by duty, not by rank. Although some believe a strict hierarchical order is necessary to maintain military organization and combat effectiveness, we will prove them wrong. An army with officer-soldier equality will be more united, and soldiers will consciously maintain discipline and be willing to give their all in battle. Everyone must pursue the dream together!"
BGD_lixiang_jianjun: "Ideal Military Building"
BGD_lixiang_jianjun_desc: "Our army originated from a dream—that everyone can live freely and peacefully, pursuing their own dreams. This dream supported our soldiers in fighting until today. We cannot abandon this military spirit; we must promote it, inspiring not only soldiers but also the citizens. This way, both the people and the military will know what they are fighting for and be willing to continue the fight."
BGD_quanmian_gaige: "Initiate Comprehensive Military Reform"
BGD_quanmian_gaige_desc: "Military reform officially begins! The threat of the East Asian State is approaching; we cannot delay. We must initiate reforms immediately so the military can defend our nation. Otherwise, when the boots of the East Asian State tread on our soil, it will be too late; dreams and hopes will be reduced to ashes."
BGD_huoli_zhishang: "Firepower Supremacy"
BGD_huoli_zhishang_desc: "For a modern military, maintaining strong firepower is crucial. The more artillery, self-propelled guns, and other equipment our military has, the more we can reduce our own casualties and quickly defeat the enemy. Moreover, the East Asian State is known for favoring firepower coverage; we cannot fall behind them. Increase investment in these areas."
BGD_zhuangjia_zuozhan: "Strengthen Armored Forces"
BGD_zhuangjia_zuozhan_desc: "If the army doesn't have a decent armored force, we cannot break through enemy lines. The status of armored forces in ground warfare, even if challenged, remains unshakable, as proven by wars spreading worldwide. Increasing investment in armored forces is crucial for the army."
BGD_houqin_gaishan: "Logistics System Improvement"
BGD_houqin_gaishan_desc: "An ancient Chinese saying goes: 'Before the troops move, the provisions must go first.' Supply lines are arguably the lifeline of an army; lack of supplies is fatal. For decades, we have hardly operated outside our homeland. If we must fight overseas someday, we must prioritize ensuring our supply lines are not cut off. Expanding and improving the logistics system is necessary for this."
BGD_weilai_zhanzheng: "Future Warfare"
BGD_weilai_zhanzheng_desc: "Since the early 2020s, global conflicts have been constant, and larger-scale wars have erupted. Nations are rapidly advancing military development under these circumstances; the future face of war is gradually emerging. Whoever takes the lead will win the future. Our military must keep pace. Exoskeletons, unmanned equipment, even Michelle battle armor—these once-fantasy weapons are now being developed and deployed. Let's increase investment in scientists and prepare for future warfare!"
BGD_zhikong_youxian: "Air Superiority Priority"
BGD_zhikong_youxian_desc: "According to some military theories, gaining air superiority equates to gaining advantage on land and sea. Therefore, ensuring air superiority is the top priority for air force development. Plans to research and produce more advanced fighter jets must begin quickly."
BGD_wuren_zhanji: "Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles"
BGD_wuren_zhanji_desc: "Our country is somewhat落后 (lagging behind) in the development of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). Therefore, we will allocate more funds to develop UCAVs, where operators can complete everything from the rear."
BGD_sanwei_zuozhan: "Coordinated Operations"
BGD_sanwei_zuozhan_desc: "Joint operations between the army, navy, and air force will yield advantages and efficiency far greater than simple addition. Our services need to establish relevant departments to coordinate their actions, making operations more efficient. This way, air force units can more effectively support ground needs, 'hitting where it doesn't work'."
BGD_kuoda_shengchan: "Expand Aircraft Production"
BGD_kuoda_shengchan_desc: "Air force strength ultimately depends on how developed the aviation industry is. Our country needs to develop its aviation industry and expand the scale of aircraft R&D and production. When advanced aircraft sufficiently meet our aerial needs, that will be the victory of our aviation industry."
BGD_chuanduo_shizhong: "Strength in Numbers of Ships"
BGD_chuanduo_shizhong_desc: "Having strong naval production capacity is most important. Our country must build more docks; naval vessels need sufficient numbers for us to achieve sea control!"
BGD_xiandai_haizhan: "Modern Naval Warfare"
BGD_xiandai_haizhan_desc: "Modern naval warfare is not what it used to be. We need to accelerate the upgrade of naval equipment and adapt to the latest naval warfare experience to not fall behind in quality."
BGD_langqun_zhanshu: "Wolfpack Tactics"
BGD_langqun_zhanshu_desc: "Our submarine force is not very strong. Developing underwater combat capability is imperative. Submarines hunting enemy ships should be like Rimi hunting chocolate coronets!"
BGD_yingdui_dongya: "Countering the East Asian State Navy"
BGD_yingdui_dongya_desc: "Although blue-water capability is the pride of a navy, given our main hypothetical enemy is the East Asian State, naval warfare is more likely to爆发 (break out) in near-sea areas. Our navy needs to better prepare for near-sea operations, especially defending against land-based naval bomber strikes. We must also strengthen our air force to support naval operations."
BGD_heping_shiyan: "Oath of Peace"
BGD_heping_shiyan_desc: "Now our military has made great progress, but we must not forget our original oath—this army was born to defend peace and dreams. Only by strengthening the ideals in soldiers' hearts and reinforcing our oath to peace can all our efforts not go astray.\n\nThe East Asian State may seem crazy, but madness cannot defeat reason. We are rationally and passionately prepared to fight for our destiny, for a glittering future—something those screaming guys in the East Asian State cannot understand. We will strictly abide by the laws of war, minimizing harm to civilians.\n\nDo not forget the oath of peace. We will forever protect this land and everyone's dreams."
BGD_luli_tongxin: "United in Heart and Effort"
BGD_luli_tongxin_desc: "The army, navy, and air force must unite to defeat a powerful enemy. Our military is a崭新的 (brand new) army; officers and soldiers are idealistic, fighting for the same goal, unlike the old Japanese military which was full of internal conflict. The department coordinating inter-service operations has matured. When comrades cooperate wholeheartedly, whether in the command center or on the battlefield, the enemy cannot shake our army."
BGD_mengxiang_zhijun: "Promote the Dream Army"
BGD_mengxiang_zhijun_desc: "Our troops come from volunteers. That so many are willing to fight to defend peace and dreams fills us with gratitude. However, insufficient recruitment has always plagued us.\n\nWe must expand publicity, telling the people this is an army born from dreams, defending dreams. Encourage more people to serve, provide tangible material rewards for enlistment, and enhance the army's role in disaster relief and assisting civilians, making helping the people its duty. Only then can this dream army move towards the future."
BGD_dingdian_zhijun: "Summit Army"
BGD_dingdian_zhijun_desc: "Finally, military reform is complete. Our military now has modern combat capabilities, the strength and confidence to defend our nation, and fight the East Asian State. However, this is not the终点 (end point)—after reaching one summit, there is always a new one.\n\nWe will not be complacent with the status quo but will always be on the road, constantly seeking new peaks. Only then will the losses and suffering we endure in war decrease, and wars end sooner. This is responsible for ourselves, the people, and peace. The summit is endless—we are the Summit Army, the army pursuing the summit."
BGD_jingji_jianshe: "Build the National Economy"
BGD_jingji_jianshe_desc: "After Japan's reconstruction is complete, we can finally begin economic construction. The goal will be to have a prosperous and developed economic system capable of supporting our various reform plans, while also allowing every citizen to benefit from it. This way, both the nation and individuals can pursue their goals and dreams.\n\nThe road ahead is tough, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Let's muster our energy and rebuild the past golden age brick by brick, surpassing the past!"
BGD_jijian_gongcheng: "Roll Out Infrastructure Projects"
BGD_jijian_gongcheng_desc: "Japan's infrastructure was severely damaged in the civil war. Although we have rebuilt much, there is still much outdated infrastructure that seems unnecessary to rebuild.既然如此 (Since that's the case), let the government take the lead, hiring post-war unemployed and homeless people to build infrastructure and housing nationwide. Many struggling related businesses can also benefit from the state's vast construction plans. This multi-purpose plan will inject a stimulant into the economy."
BGD_qvyv_fazhan: "Promote Regional Development"
BGD_qvyv_fazhan_desc: "Development across Japan's regions is uneven, which is normal. But this doesn't mean we do nothing. We will construct according to local conditions, promote regions to explore their own economic development models, and ensure all people benefit. This is what we must do."
BGD_gaokeji_fazhan: "Develop High-Tech Enterprises"
BGD_gaokeji_fazhan_desc: "Japan was once world-renowned for its advanced technology, but now these are just past glories. Our current impression is one of rigidity and resistance to change. Improving this impression will start with our encouragement and funding of tech enterprises. Our country will once again lead the world in technological development. From civilian entertainment tech to industrial and military high-tech, these technologies will emerge in futuristic forms, greatly enhancing social vitality and production efficiency."
BGD_zhongxiao_qiye: "Subsidize Private Small and Medium Enterprises"
BGD_zhongxiao_qiye_desc: "Among the losses from the war, private small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were hit the hardest. These enterprises span various industries, are pioneers of innovation, and are an indispensable part of economic development and job creation. They provide services for daily life and meet convenience needs; many hold warm daily memories with loved ones, like the livehouses we performed in and the shops in shopping streets.\n\nThey are the foundation of our economy, but many have already gone bankrupt, with many more on the brink. We certainly cannot stand by. These enterprises and shops must receive financial subsidies, tax reductions, and policy support to help them survive, develop further, and prosper again."
BGD_fazhan_zhonggong: "Heavy Industry and Military Industry Development"
BGD_fazhan_zhonggong_desc: "Mentioning heavy industry, people might think it has little to do with their lives and has negative impressions like high pollution and danger. But heavy industry built modern industrial society; maintaining convenient modern life requires it as a foundation.\n\nCurrently, facing an aggressive East Asian State, our military construction's demand for industry is growing. Without sufficiently developed heavy and military industry, we cannot defeat the East Asian State's heavily armed大军 (large army). The government will invest in heavy industry and control its development by nationalizing these enterprises."
BGD_beibu_fazhan: "Northern Development"
BGD_beibu_fazhan_desc: "The northern region is one of Japan's less developed areas, mostly rural, and likely to remain so. Plans targeting this region's development have been approved."
BGD_zhongbu_fazhan: "Central Development"
BGD_zhongbu_fazhan_desc: "The central region is now our country's most densely populated area and has always been the national core. Promoting its development is urgent."
BGD_xiangcun_zhenxing: "Rural Revitalization"
BGD_xiangcun_zhenxing_desc: "For a long time, Japan's rural population has been flowing to cities, causing rural areas to continuously decline. But we cannot stop people from rushing to big cities pursuing better lives.\n\nWhat we must do is promote rural agricultural development and cooperation, enhance rural tourism, relocate some light industry to rural areas, renovate rural infrastructure, and encourage some people tired of city life to return to rural居住 (residence), among other measures. This way, rural life can also have a future and dreams to pursue, and乐趣 (fun) to find, keeping people in the countryside."
BGD_nanbu_fazhan: "Southern Development"
BGD_nanbu_fazhan_desc: "The southern region is Japan's traditionally developed area and was historically important for foreign exchange. We will vigorously develop this region, allowing it to continue shouldering the responsibility of leading our country to the world."
BGD_liangshi_ziji: "Ensure Food Self-Sufficiency"
BGD_liangshi_ziji_desc: "Japan's food self-sufficiency rate has always been a major issue. Many worry that if war breaks out, we might even face famine. But now, with rural revitalization and domestic agricultural development, we can greatly alleviate this problem. However,完全解决 (complete resolution) is impossible. We还需要 (also need to) rebuild food import routes with allies and friendly nations and must not forget to continue promoting domestic food production to protect citizens from the risk of hunger."
BGD_dachengshi_zhiguang: "Light of the Major Cities"
BGD_dachengshi_zhiguang_desc: "Japan's major cities have always led economic development, even as they continuously absorb人口和资源 (population and resources) from surrounding areas. People coming to these cities to pursue their dreams are endless. We must expand these cities' infrastructure and services, making them feel warm even away from home. Simultaneously, we will invest heavily in these cities to promote their development, elevating our economy further."
BGD_xianjin_wenyv: "Strive for Energy Self-Sufficiency"
BGD_xianjin_wenyv_desc: "Our country lacks resources and has never been abundant in energy. We will use advanced technology to promote our energy development. A nuclear energy plan will also be launched. Of course, the government has promised the public that the nuclear plan的前提 (prerequisite) is increased inspection and maintenance of nuclear plant facilities to ensure no accidents happen again."
BGD_wangluo_geming: "Network Revolution"
BGD_wangluo_geming_desc: "For years, the network has become an indispensable part of people's lives; its role in social and economic life can no longer be ignored. The government should also participate, not only promoting network information enterprises but also using network channels for social governance, political construction, and economic development. The network revolution is upon us."
BGD_gaozhi_jingji: "High-Quality Economy"
BGD_gaozhi_jingji_desc: "Now, our economy is beginning to develop towards high quality. The application of advanced technology in economic activities is everywhere, industrial production line efficiency has greatly improved, traditional production methods are exiting the stage, and innovation has reached another高潮 (climax).\n\nThe futuristic high-tech life imagined decades ago hasn't fully arrived, but reality has already翻天覆地 (undergone earth-shaking changes). We believe that in the near future, we can realize all our beautiful imaginations about the future."
BGD_jingji_qiji: "Economic Miracle!"
BGD_jingji_qiji_desc: "Now, another golden economic era for our country has arrived. We have accomplished the arduous task of building an incredibly prosperous economy. Thanks to the mysterious guitar uniting hearts, greatly enhancing people's work vitality and efficiency, but更应该感谢 (we should be even more grateful for) each person's contribution and effort.\n\nWith a prosperous economy and a system benefiting everyone, we finally no longer need to worry about material problems and can boldly pursue dreams. The social atmosphere is renewed; everyone holds their head high again, with dreams and hope as the theme. The clouds of the past are gone; let's look forward, no longer缅怀 (lingering on) the past!"
BGD_yazi_zuzhi: "Establish Asia-Pacific Free Nations Organization"
BGD_yazi_zuzhi_desc: "Since China was consumed by evil supernatural forces and transformed into the 'East Asian State', the EAS has threatened the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region with unprecedented aggression. Faced with this, we cannot sit idly by just because we promised peace.相反 (On the contrary), to truly defend peace and dreams, we must establish a political-military organization encompassing all Asia-Pacific nations—the Asia-Pacific Free Nations Organization (APFNO for short)—to counter the evil EAS forces, hoping to one day completely erase the shadow of totalitarianism from over our heads.\n\nUnite, people who love peace and freedom, unite for the dream!"
BGD_duikang_dongya: "Counter East Asian Ambition"
BGD_duikang_dongya_desc: "Many might see the EAS as China's successor, thinking it's just China renamed. But that's not true. According to a report by our intelligence agency head Nanami, the EAS is forging a new East Asian national and ethnic identity, attempting to completely erase the concept of China, later including us and the Korean Peninsula—once they conquer it. Thus, China is the first victim of the EAS, and the people of that ancient land have not屈服 (submitted); many are rising up against the EAS's totalitarian rule and its ambition to eliminate Chinese identity.\n\nWe must recognize that China and its people are not our enemies. We should strongly support the Chinese people's resistance, letting the EAS's ambitious individuals drown in the wrath of free people."
BGD_guoji_zhichi: "Seek International Support"
BGD_guoji_zhichi_desc: "The EAS may have tried to disguise itself, but it cannot hide its overwhelming ambition. Its evil plans are gradually being exposed to the world. Our country must seize this opportunity to explain the EAS's ambitions to nations worldwide, gaining international support and aid, and use this chance to strengthen cooperation with allies."
BGD_tuanjie_yatai: "Unite Asia-Pacific Allies"
BGD_tuanjie_yatai_desc: "Most members within the APFNO joined out of fear of EAS aggression and expansion. But that is not enough; fear alone cannot unite hearts. Our country must also reaffirm the organization's shared values and common goals with allies—creating a free and peaceful Asia where everyone can live without fear, pursuing dreams together under the same sky. This way, the APFNO can truly unite and collaborate unreservedly against the EAS."
BGD_chuanbo_shanyao: "Spread Glitter-ism"
BGD_chuanbo_shanyao_desc: "A bold plan has been proposed—spread our Glitter-ism to our ally nations. We will fund Glitter-ism supporters within ally countries, organize them to form parties, participate in elections through legal democratic means, and strive to gain power.\n\nAs long as we share the same ideology and pursue dreams together,相信 (we believe) internal cooperation阻力 (resistance) will be much smaller. But many will condemn this as interference in internal affairs. We will try to alleviate these concerns... with large economic investments and aid construction plans."
BGD_chengli_jingjiquan: "Establish Internal Economic Circle"
BGD_chengli_jingjiquan_desc: "The world has undergone earth-shaking changes in recent years, and not positive ones. The chain crisis from the US collapse has severely挫 (set back) globalization and international trade, which Japan heavily relies on. Therefore, it is necessary to make economic function a goal of building the APFNO.\n\nWe will establish an internal economic circle within the organization, creating a pan-Asia-Pacific market, eliminating tariff trade barriers between nations, allowing our goods to be exported, greatly alleviating the economic crisis we face."
BGD_wenhua_jiaoliu: "Deepen Cultural Exchange"
BGD_wenhua_jiaoliu_desc: "People between our country and ally nations should deepen exchange and understanding for more effective cooperation. Large-scale cultural and youth exchange activities will be held between nations, while reducing censorship of cultural products, allowing better circulation between countries. And we will certainly have our cultural and entertainment industry workers put in more effort, striving to make our culture popular across Asia-Pacific nations, strengthening our position as a leading nation."
BGD_keji_xiezuo: "Scientific and Technological R&D Collaboration"
BGD_keji_xiezuo_desc: "The EAS has many clever minds; regardless of why they serve the EAS, they make its technology a serious threat to the APFNO. Our organization cannot fall behind; we must establish effective scientific research exchange and collaboration mechanisms between member nations, sharing the latest technological achievements, proving our intelligence is second to none!"
BGD_shendu_hezuo: "Deep Cooperation"
BGD_shendu_hezuo_desc: "Now is the time to strengthen cooperation between our country and allies. Comprehensive deep cooperation will be established within the APFNO, covering all aspects. We will cooperate with allies almost unreservedly. When we unite, cooperation efficiency will be astonishingly high, far exceeding simple addition. The EAS will find itself facing an indestructible organization."
BGD_tuanjie_shijie: "Unite as One, the World is With Us"
BGD_tuanjie_shijie_desc: "Free people, unite! The EAS tyrant intends to crush our dreams, making everyone live in a future without light. We will not let them succeed! Even though severe conflicts have erupted between world nations, when facing an unprecedented threat like the EAS, countries can temporarily set aside differences and unite. Our planes will fly to nations worldwide,争取 (seeking) support from the world. From foreign governments to international organizations and private individuals, their help is incredibly precious and touching; we will thank them.\n\nOur future is not pessimistic. Even with temporary difficulties, the world's just forces support our cause from behind. Dreams will ultimately pierce through the tyrant!"
BGD_zuizhong_zhizhan: "The Battle of Dreams, Freedom, and Destiny!"
BGD_zuizhong_zhizhan_desc: "The EAS has bared its fangs; war has erupted in the world's most densely populated and affluent region. This battle may not only decide our destiny but also the world's future. We, for ourselves and humanity's future, will fight to the last moment! This is our battle of dreams, freedom, and destiny!"
BGD_shangdianjie_xingdong: "Operation Shopping District"
BGD_shangdianjie_xingdong_desc: "Operation Shopping District has been formulated, focusing on the Northeast Asia and Taiwan Strait theaters, aiming to clear peripheral obstacles for the assault on the EAS mainland. EAS forces will desperately resist our entry into their homeland, but we will ultimately tear open the EAS防线 (defensive line)."
BGD_dongbeiya_zhanyi: "Northeast Asia Campaign"
BGD_dongbeiya_zhanyi_desc: "The Korean Peninsula and Northeast region of the EAS are key targets of Operation Shopping District. Once captured, our military can not only ensure homeland security but also directly threaten the EAS capital. We will fight on plains, mountains, forests, and hills; bloody battles are inevitable. But fearing no sacrifice will eventually bring the dawn of victory."
BGD_taihai_zhanyi: "Taiwan Strait Operation"
BGD_taihai_zhanyi_desc: "The EAS's eastern coastal region is its core area. To attack from the sea, Taiwan, as an important forward base, is essential. We will ensure firm control of the Taiwan Strait area, preparing for the final assault on the EAS mainland."
BGD_ring_xingdong: "Operation Ring"
BGD_ring_xingdong_desc: "Operation Ring has been formulated, focusing on South Asia. By removing EAS influence in South Asia, we hope to relieve India's military pressure there, allowing Indian forces to support our other theaters."
BGD_jibai_pak: "Defeat Pakistan"
BGD_jibai_pak_desc: "Pakistan constantly threatens the Indian mainland. India has requested we launch a joint operation to defeat Pakistan and eliminate this largest threat in South Asia."
BGD_nanya_xiaoguo: "Pacify South Asian Minor Nations"
BGD_nanya_xiaoguo_desc: "There are several minor nations in South Asia that are EAS allies. We must eliminate the military threat from these minor nations. This way, the Indian Ocean will be under our control."
BGD_circle_xingdong: "Operation Circle"
BGD_circle_xingdong_desc: "Operation Circle has been formulated, targeting Southeast Asia. By destroying the two administrative governments the EAS established here, their southern border will be exposed to our threat, and our Southeast Asian allies can breathe easier."
BGD_miandian_zhanyi: "Myanmar Campaign"
BGD_miandian_zhanyi_desc: "The situation in Myanmar is complex, the terrain tricky, but capturing it can cut off the EAS's access to the Indian Ocean. Take action!"
BGD_yuenan_zhanyi: "Vietnam Campaign"
BGD_yuenan_zhanyi_desc: "The plan to attack the EAS's south from Vietnam and its neighbors may not be fully executed but can greatly tie down EAS forces. Cutting the Indochina administrative region in half might be a good进攻办法 (offensive method)."
BGD_space_jihua: "Plan Space"
BGD_space_jihua_desc: "Plan Space aims to transition our country to a wartime system. With the clouds of war overhead, the people must unite so our dreams and freedom can be defended."
BGD_chongran_jingshen: "Reignite the Civil War Spirit"
BGD_chongran_jingshen_desc: "When the civil war first broke out, we were also anxious and uneasy, but we mustered courage, faced the threats and dark future, and ultimately fought for our future,掌控 (gaining control of) our own destiny. Now a similar situation occurs again. We must awaken the people's spirit from the civil war era, rekindling the spirit of不屈 (unyielding) for dreams in everyone's heart. Whether it's SDF warlords or EAS tyrants, we will not fear!"
BGD_zhanshi_zhuangtai: "Activate Wartime Status"

BGD_yuanzhu_dikang: "Aid Resistance Groups Within the EAS"
BGD_yuanzhu_dikang_desc: "Within the EAS, not everyone bows in submission as the tyrants think; the spark of resistance has never been extinguished. As someone in China once said: 'A single spark can start a prairie fire.' These brave resisters are fighting for freedom and the restoration of China, even at the risk of惨死 (dying horribly). We cannot turn a blind eye; we must aid them, proving we stand with the Chinese people, and the EAS tyrant is our common enemy. They will drown in the people's raging tide!"
BGD_jixian_dongyuan: "National Maximum Mobilization"
BGD_jixian_dongyuan_desc: "Only by being strong enough can we ultimately liberate people oppressed by totalitarianism. Our country will further strengthen the wartime system, mobilize all forces, continuously support the frontline, and彻底摧毁 (completely destroy) the EAS army. However, the people need to endure for a while."
BGD_zhameng_xingdong: "Operation Code: Dream Bomb"
BGD_zhameng_xingdong_desc: "EAS resistance is gradually crumbling; they are on their last legs, and the dawn of victory finally appears. However, as long as the supernatural force influencing the EAS exists, they might continue using it to drag people into fighting, pulling us all into endless war. Fortunately, we have identified the entity carrying this evil supernatural force. Destroying it will likely cause the EAS's power to collapse instantly.\n\nOperation Dream Bomb is officially launched. Gentlemen, good luck! Our peace rests on you!"

Those ghosts stained with blood, those lies distorting the truth, must be彻底清除 (thoroughly purged). To let light illuminate every corner, we must清算 (settle accounts for) the crimes of the old era, tear off the hypocritical veil, and let the flames of justice burn away all filth.

The Glitter Party government决定 (has decided) to embark on the difficult road to truth and reconciliation with the utmost sincerity and determination. We will establish a 'Truth and Reconciliation Commission', composed of representatives from the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and various sectors of society, to comprehensively investigate historical遗留问题 (legacy issues), listen to the voices of victims, and deeply reflect on war crimes. This is not only responsible to history but also to the future.
