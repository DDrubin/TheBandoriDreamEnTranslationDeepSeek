lower_academic_desc: "At this level, access to basic education is exceptionally difficult for many. Illiteracy is widespread, and individuals may struggle to acquire fundamental cognitive skills. This stage is characterized by severely restricted access to formal learning and knowledge acquisition."
low_academic_desc: "Significant effort is invested in tackling mass illiteracy; a large portion of the population has acquired basic literacy and numeracy. While there is some development in cognitive abilities, the focus remains on foundational knowledge, and opportunities for individuals to access more advanced knowledge are still limited."
medium_academic_desc: "Society has developed to a point where most individuals possess functional competence across various cognitive domains. Basic education is widespread, and people can effectively apply their knowledge to meet daily challenges. This stage shows a more pragmatic orientation in understanding concepts and problem-solving skills."
high_academic_desc: "At this stage, individuals move beyond functional competence to develop critical thinking skills. Education encourages analytical reasoning, independent thought, and deep contemplation of complex concepts. Society places greater value on intellectual curiosity, encouraging individuals to question, analyze, and synthesize information."
higher_academic_desc: "This represents the pinnacle of intellectual development a society can achieve. Individuals are not only well-educated but are also encouraged to pursue intellectual excellence. Higher education and research are highly valued; society prizes innovation, promotes a culture of lifelong learning, and fosters an environment that encourages the pursuit of intellectual achievement."
lower_farming_desc: "At this stage, society relies primarily on subsistence-based, low-productivity agriculture. Access to food is difficult; communities struggle to meet basic nutritional needs, and agricultural practices are traditional and inefficient."
low_farming_desc: "Society achieves basic food security with improvements in agricultural production. Farming methods are enhanced, leading to some growth in productivity. However, a diverse and nutritious diet remains elusive, and communities may still face occasional food shortages."
medium_farming_desc: "Society adopts more sustainable agricultural models, emphasizing soil conservation, water management, and crop rotation. This level signifies a more stable and reliable food supply; communities can consistently access the nutrition their members need, with significant reductions in periodic food shortages."
high_farming_desc: "Agriculture becomes a source of prosperity, with diversification of crops and livestock. Advanced agricultural techniques, adoption of new technologies, and agricultural diversification enable higher productivity and economic development. This stage implies society has sufficient, nutritious food, contributing to overall health and well-being."

low_poverty_desc: "At this level, society faces widespread financial strain; per capita income remains insufficient for a comfortable standard of living. Many struggle with economic challenges, and access to education, healthcare, and basic services is still limited."
medium_poverty_desc: "This stage reflects a situation where most people face moderate income difficulties. While there might be occasional higher economic activity, per capita income is still not high, and a significant portion of the population finds it hard to maintain a stable and satisfactory quality of life."
high_poverty_desc: "As more individuals achieve middle-income status, society begins to transform. Per capita income rises, and a considerable portion of the population enjoys greater financial comfort. However, income inequality persists, affecting social justice."
higher_poverty_desc: "This represents the peak of economic well-being development, characterized by sustained prosperity and economic health. Per capita income is greatly increased, and most people enjoy a high quality of life. Access to education, healthcare, and overall well-being is abundant, heralding a prosperous and just society."
lower_industry_desc: "This represents the initial stage of industrialization: products are primarily handmade, relying on manual tools. Mechanization is quite low at this stage, and most economic activity is small-scale and localized."
low_industry_desc: "At this stage, mechanization begins to develop as basic machinery enters manufacturing. Small workshops and factories start using simple machines, improving efficiency and output. However, the scale of industrialization remains limited compared to higher stages."
medium_industry_desc: "Marked by the emergence of industrial complexes, society takes a significant leap in industrialization. Advanced machinery and technology become more accessible, enabling mass production of goods. Industry has moved beyond basic handicrafts, and the production process for industrial goods is becoming increasingly standardized."
high_industry_desc: "This stage signifies a high level of industrialization with the integrated development of high-tech across various sectors. Industry becomes more complex, involving sophisticated production processes and specialized technologies. The economy exhibits industrial diversification and places greater emphasis on research, development, and innovation than in the past."
higher_industry_desc: "At this highest stage of industrialization, society reaches a new phase characterized by high technology, automation, and a mature industrial internet. Modern industry includes cutting-edge production technologies, advanced infrastructure, and a more complex and refined economic ecosystem. Society shows significant improvements in innovation and efficiency, with specialized industries covering a wider range and enabling higher-quality development and a more competitive economy."
lower_military_desc: "This stage reflects a lack of organization, discipline, and professionalism within the military. Units or individuals at this stage may exhibit disorganization, lack of training, and very low adherence to established protocols."
low_military_desc: "At this stage, the military begins to take shape, focusing on basic training and initial formation. Novice troops concentrate on instilling discipline, basic tactics, and adherence to military procedures. However, they may still lack the experience and proficiency seen at more advanced stages."
medium_military_desc: "The military achieves a certain level of operational capability, demonstrating proficiency in core skills, tactical understanding, and adherence to established standards. Units or individuals at this stage show a higher level of professionalism, emphasizing teamwork, effective communication, and mastery of basic military tasks."
high_military_desc: "At this stage, the military possesses a high degree of expertise and skill. Units within the force can execute complex missions with precision, demonstrate superior tactical acumen, and maintain a high standard of professionalism. The force emphasizes continuous training, education, and adaptability to meet evolving challenges."
higher_military_desc: "The ultimate peak of military power, a force recognized as elite among elites, unrivaled in all domains. This stage signifies not only complete mastery of conventional warfare but also proficiency in特种作战特种作战 (special operations), such as special forces, cyber warfare, and intelligence. Armies reaching this level are globally renowned for their exceptional discipline, superior strategic thinking,强大的适应能力强大的适应能力 (powerful adaptability), and高度的专业素养高度的专业素养 (high degree of professionalism)."
lower_society_desc: "In this turbulent stage, society is chaotic, lacking organized structure, advanced technology, and effective governance. People's primary focus is basic survival, with little attention paid to social cohesion or long-term planning."
low_society_desc: "Amidst the chaos, corruption has taken root, undermining institutions and eroding social trust. Governance is compromised, and ethical standards are declining. Corruption permeates all aspects of public life, hindering progress, breeding discontent, and straining the social fabric."
medium_society_desc: "Recognizing the challenges of corruption and moral decline, society begins efforts to rebuild integrity. Reforms are implemented to address institutional weaknesses, eradicate corruption, and restore public trust. The focus is on laying the foundation for a more transparent and accountable governance system."
high_society_desc: "At this stage, society achieves significant progress in economic development, technology, and social welfare. Institutions are strengthened, providing a stable framework for development. Education and innovation become focal points, leading to improved quality of life, increased opportunities, and more equitable distribution of resources."
