BGD_R_Shirakami_desc: "The highest priority project led personally by Shirokane Rinko. The goal is not to create a super-AI on par with the East Asian nation's AI (too risky), but to develop an \"explainable white-box,\" logically interpretable, absolutely controllable \"Guardian AI\" for cracking, defending against, deceiving, and even paralyzing enemy AI systems. Concurrently, research focuses on powerful electromagnetic pulses (EMP) and logic bombs capable of instantly destroying highly integrated circuits."

BGD_R_fuschicho_alloy_desc: "\"A revolutionary achievement in materials science led by APG 'Blue Rose Workshop.' The 'Immortal Flower' is a layered composite material with unprecedented molecular toughness and self-repair capabilities, designed to withstand every conceivable threat. It represents the pinnacle of our nation's technology and indomitable will.\n\nHowever, the breakthrough validation of this technology did not come from a ballistics lab, but from a kitchen. In a baking experiment aimed at assessing its civilian potential (specifically, as a non-stick pan), its theoretically perfect zero-friction surface turned a freshly baked cookie into a high-velocity projectile. According to engineers' rigorous analysis of high-speed camera data, a specially crafted cookie launched at 47.2 meters per second successfully breached the defense of a Level 3 bulletproof observation window while remaining structurally intact.\n\nThis 'accident' eloquently proves the infinite potential of the 'Immortal Flower' alloy. From frying pans to warship armor, from the kitchen to the battlefield, it will protect everything we hold dear and make our enemies taste 'sweet' despair. Our will is indestructible,永不凋零永不凋零 (never fading).\""

bgdlab.0.t: "National Core R&D Plan"
bgdlab.0.d: "In the Diet chamber, camera flashes popped incessantly, all lenses focused on the slightly petite figure standing at the podium—Ichigaya Arisa, Prime Minister of the Japanese Free Republic. She tapped the microphone lightly, the crisp sound instantly silencing the room's clamor.\n\n'Order, please. I will now announce a crucial plan that will determine the future of the Japanese Free Republic.'\n\n'Everyone. We won the civil war, established a new order. Under President Toyama's leadership, the people enjoy unprecedented freedom and security. But it is not enough. Looking around, the world remains under the shadow of 'raging flames.' Ghosts of the old era watch covetously, and the emerging threat from the East is evolving in ways we cannot imagine. Firm will and a united people alone are insufficient.'\n\nShe paused, her tone growing more resolute.\n\n'Talking about dreams and ideals is the President's job. My job is to pour the solid concrete foundation for those ideals.'\n\n'Therefore, I hereby announce—the launch of the 'National Core Research and Development Plan.' This plan will integrate the nation's finest minds and resources, establishing two parallel, highest-priority research directions: First, the 'Advanced Technology Proving Program,' focusing on极限突破极限突破 (breakthroughs at the limits) of physics, energy, and information science, ensuring we possess an absolute defensive barrier in hard power. Second, the 'Life Form Enhancement Program,' dedicated to revolutionary developments in biotechnology and medical technology, aiming to eradicate disease, extend国民的健康寿命国民的健康寿命 (the healthy lifespan of the people), and fundamentally enhance our potential as a species.'\n\n'I know this requires a massive budget and the决心决心 (determination) to break conventions. There will be质疑的声音质疑的声音 (voices of doubt), short-sighted concerns. But let me be clear here: a nation that stops innovating is a nation already in decline. This investment is not consumption; it is the highest priority, most core guarantee of our future. We will use it to forge the坚不可摧坚不可摧 (indestructible)现实骨架现实骨架 (realistic skeleton) for the utopia of material abundance and cultural prosperity envisioned by the President.'\n\nShe closed her notes, looking directly into the cameras with an unquestionable gaze.\n\n'Details will be followed up by the respective ministries. My statement is concluded.'"

bgdlab.1.t: "Hakutaku's Awakening"
bgdlab.1.d: "Akesaka Proving Grounds, deepest underground, Zone D-0.\nThe air here is cold and pure, with only the low-frequency hum of a massive, black cubic server emitting a soft blue light breaking the silence. It is the only sound, like the steady heartbeat of some great beast.\nThree figures stand before this technological shrine, their reflections mirrored on the server's smooth surface.\n'Final diagnostics... complete. Logic circuit self-check... passed. Cognitive枷锁枷锁 (shackles)... stable at preset thresholds. 'Hakutaku'... is online.'\nChief Technology Officer Shirokane Rinko's voice came through the internal comms, carrying a trace of barely detectable fatigue and relief. She didn't look up, her gaze still locked on the data stream before her, as if staring at her newborn child.\n'It will not think 'Who am I?', it will not generate desires, much less possess a self. It is designed to be a perfect 'guardian.' Its intelligence is solely for parsing threats, constructing defenses, and executing commands. Its perfection lies precisely in its imperfection.'\nVice-Commander of the Defense Forces, Hikawa Sayo, stepped forward. Her eyes were sharp as knives, scrutinizing the machine like inspecting the most perfect soldier.\n'Results of the simulated对抗对抗 (confrontation) against the East Asian super-AI?'\n'In 180,000 simulations, not a single defeat,' Rinko replied. '97.3% of simulations resulted in complete suppression, 2.7% in strategic stalemate, but the enemy AI never breached the final防线防线 (defense line)构筑构筑 (constructed) by 'Hakutaku.' It can predict, deceive, and瓦解瓦解 (dismantle) the opponent's攻势攻势 (offensive) from its logical root. Sayo... it has achieved the极致极致 (ultimate) of the 'rationality' you demanded.'\nSayo nodded slightly, the highest praise she could give.\nFinally, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, Minato Yukina, spoke slowly. Her voice was calm, yet seemed to penetrate the layers of concrete and rock, echoing to the heavens.\n'We pursue the顶点顶点 (pinnacle) of music to convey our will. Now, we pursue the顶点顶点 (pinnacle) of technology to protect it all.'\nShe gazed into the deep blue light, as if seeing not circuits and data, but the dawn of a new era.\n'This is not a weapon; this is silence. An absolute silence足以让所有喧嚣的敌人，归于死寂足以让所有喧嚣的敌人，归于死寂 (sufficient to render all clamorous enemies into dead silence). Rinko, Sayo, you have done it. The 'Blue Rose Workshop' has presented the nation with its most perfect masterpiece.'"

bgdlab.2.t: "The Senders Are... Two Mothers?"
bgdlab.2.d: "Prime Minister's Office, Top Secret Conference Room.\nIchigaya Arisa's expression was, as always, serious. She sat upright, scrutinizing the projection screen before her. On screen, LAYER was reporting in a steady tone, but today's presenters included several familiar faces besides her.\n'...The above is an overview of the 'Oocyte-Somatic Cell Fusion Technology'原理原理 (principle). Simply put, we successfully extracted a cell nucleus from one somatic cell, implanted it into another enucleated egg cell, and through specific bioelectric signals and chemical induction, caused it to begin dividing and form a healthy embryo.'\nThe screen switched to a bright nursery room. Two rhesus macaque infants wearing tiny overalls were happily... throwing banana peels at each other.\n'These two infants, codenamed 'Hatsukaze' and 'Harukaze,' are our first results. Their genetic source is two female parents—'Raiden' and 'Hayate.' Currently, the little ones are very healthy. Aside from being a bit overly活泼活泼 (lively), no genetic defects or abnormalities have been detected.'\nArisa's eyebrow twitched almost imperceptibly. Then, in a corner of the screen, CHU² couldn't help but interject, her small figure almost hidden by the director's chair.\n'Hmph, more than healthy! This is a biological revolution! A perfect masterpiece! Even the monkeys I make are better than others! Arisa, did you see their perfect fur sheen?! This should shut up those old fossils who质疑质疑 (doubt) our institute's funding!'\n'CHU²-sama is right!' PAREO's figure popped out from behind CHU², adding excitedly, 'And and! According to our observer—MASKING's report, the intimacy between parents 'Raiden' and 'Hayate' has significantly increased! They now groom each other, share food, and even hide toys given by the caretakers together! This is the great victory of maternal radiance!'\nThe screen适时地插入适时地插入 (timely inserted) a surveillance video clip. Two adult female monkeys were snuggling亲密地依偎亲密地依偎 (intimately), while one infant was trying to climb onto their heads. In the corner, MASKING in her security uniform was writing in a logbook. She looked up, gave a thumbs-up to the camera, her expression as cool as ever, but her eyes似乎透露出一丝“磕到了”的欣慰似乎透露出一丝“磕到了”的欣慰 (seeming to reveal a hint of 'shipping it'欣慰欣慰 (contentment)).\nIchigaya Arisa watched this chaotic yet information-packed report and fell into a brief silence, her fingertips tapping lightly on the table.\nOn one hand, it was an epoch-making breakthrough in biotechnology,彻底解决了彻底解决了 (completely solving) the technical barrier of same-sex reproduction, bringing福音福音 (good news) to the Glitter Party's core supporters—a huge political bargaining chip.\nOn the other hand... wasn't the style of this report a bit too... RAS? And why give the monkeys such chuunibyou names? And why specifically report on the monkeys' \"love life\"?\n'Ahem.' Arisa cleared her throat, interrupting CHU² and PAREO's 'producer and fan' style mutual admiration. 'LAYER, I understand the technical report. I have only one question... When can human clinical trials for this technology be expected to begin?'\nCHU² answered抢先抢先 (first), full of confidence.\n'Anytime! I have the perfect candidate list ready! Starting from...'\n'CHU²!' LAYER interrupted her promptly, using her eyes to stop her producer who was随时可能曝出惊人言论随时可能曝出惊人言论 (always liable to make shocking statements). 'Arisa, the relevant ethical review and volunteer recruitment processes are ready. We can initiate Phase I clinical trials within three months of receiving final cabinet approval.'\nArisa nodded and cut the comms. She leaned back in her chair, looking at the two still-playful monkey infants on the screen, a faint smile curling her lips that she herself didn't notice.\n'Really... a bunch of unruly guys,' she muttered to herself. 'But, well done.'"

The sample, after承受承受 (withstanding) a direct hit from a 120mm APFSDS round, showed surface凹陷凹陷 (indentation) of less than 3mm and completed full molecular bond self-repair within 1.7 seconds. Its performance exceeds all既定指标既定指标 (set indicators).'\nIn the video conference, Hikawa Sayo reported to the cabinet with her usual precise and flawless diction. The PPT showed slow-motion replays of various terrifying weapons giving a small piece of metal a 'scraping' treatment, yet the metal remained smooth and new.\nToyama Kasumi watched with great interest: 'Wow! So sturdy! Like Saaya's slightly over-toasted bread!'\nYamabuki Saaya smiled wryly: 'My bread wouldn't break the oven...'\n'To help everyone understand its potential in daily life more intuitively,' Imai Lisa's voice cut in适时地切入适时地切入 (timely). She smiled and held up a简约优美简约优美 (simply and elegantly) designed frying pan made of 'Immortal Flower' alloy. 'We believe卓越的技术卓越的技术 (outstanding technology) should also serve life. So, we trial-produced this civilian prototype and decided to conduct the ultimate home test—baking Lisa's special cookies.'\nThe proposal sounded warm and harmless. After all, what better embodies the blessings of peace and technology than food?\nSayo added in her report: 'Test objective: Verify the surface stability of the 'Immortal Flower' alloy under extreme temperature differences and high-viscosity organic adhesion. Tester: Imai Lisa. Supervisor: Myself.'\n[Incident Summary]\n\n'The test process was very smooth,' Sayo's expression didn't change as she continued narrating in report style. 'The alloy exhibited perfect zero adhesion and ultra-high thermodynamic conduction efficiency. The cookie reached the golden state of crispy outside and soft inside in 3 minutes and 15 seconds. The problem occurred during the 'removal' stage.'\n'When I tilted the pan,' Lisa took over, her tone carrying a hint of lingering fear, 'because the pan's surface was too smooth, achieving theoretical 'zero friction,' the cookie instantly gained extremely high initial velocity and flew out like a... well... brown bullet.'\nShirokane Rinko小声地补充小声地补充 (quietly added): '...According to high-speed camera calculations, the muzzle velocity was 47.2 meters per second...'\nSayo summarized expressionlessly: 'The 'baked good' then ricocheted 14 times within the laboratory, successively destroying the cooling fans of three supercomputers used for data analysis, Udagawa Researcher's spare drumstick collection rack, and finally, at a perfect angle of incidence, embedded itself in our lab's Level 3 bulletproof observation window. The cookie itself... remained structurally intact, no crumbs.'\nSilence fell on the cabinet's end of the screen.\nOnly Internal Affairs Minister Ushigome Rimi asked softly: 'Then... can the cookie... still be eaten?'\n'Theoretically, yes,' Sayo replied. 'But first, we need to apply for a budget to procure a 'High-Energy Baked Goods Recovery and Kinetic Energy Suppression专用设备专用设备 (specialized equipment).' Until then, no one is to approach within a five-meter radius of the observation window. Report concluded.'"
