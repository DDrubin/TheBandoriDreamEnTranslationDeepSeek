BGD_rocket_architecture: "How to Draw a Rocket That Doesn't Explode?"
BGD_sasa_building: "Build a Giant Slingshot Next to the Equator"
BGD_focus_astronaut_selection: "It's Decided! You Will Land on the Moon!"
BGD_focus_manned_centrifuge: "Spinning at High Speed Again Today"
BGD_focus_anti_weightlessness_training: "Gravity, Stop Messing Around!"
BGD_focus_temperature_training: "Into the Steamer One Second, Into the Fridge the Next"
BGD_focus_simulator_training: "Crash Enough on Earth First"
BGD_focus_space_EVA_training: "Walking in a Straight Line in Space is Super Hard!"
BGD_focus_landing_moon: "Hold a Concert on the Moon!"

BGD_rocket_architecture_desc: "Every rocket starts from a blank piece of paper. We're sketching while figuring out how not to make it explode."
BGD_sasa_building_desc: "Singapore: Low latitude, big enthusiasm! We're building a space base here that will make Earth's gravity tremble! In the future, this will be the first launchpad for dreams to take off!"
BGD_focus_astronaut_selection_desc: "After several rounds of rigorous selection (mainly rock-paper-scissors and talent shows), our heroes are finally assembled! It's time to show the world what it means for dreams to break through Earth!"
BGD_focus_manned_centrifuge_desc: "Want to become an astronaut? First, experience what it's like to be 'so dizzy you question life'! The centrifuge is roaring, we're roaring, but it's okay, hang in there, the dream is right over there!"
BGD_focus_anti_weightlessness_training_desc: "Gravity? Doesn't exist! To play drums and dance (?) in zero gravity, our astronauts are working hard to break free from Earth's bonds! (Reminder: Please do not attempt to take off without authorization)"
BGD_focus_temperature_training_desc: "On the Moon, you can fry eggs during the day and freeze fish at night. So, to avoid being cooked or turned into popsicles, we've launched devilish temperature difference training! Bring your thermos!"
BGD_focus_simulator_training_desc: "If you don't crash, it's not a simulation. Keep failing, keep trying again. Even if we accidentally break the lander's leg by fumbling, we can fix it with tape and dreams! (Theoretically)"
BGD_focus_space_EVA_training_desc: "How to save fuel? How to change orbit? Don't ask, just learn while flying! Here, every drop of propellant is expensive enough to fund a concert, so we must fly accurately and stylishly!"
BGD_focus_landing_moon_desc: "Landing on the moon isn't a simple 'hop'—it must be precise, graceful, and land like the perfect ending pose after the final beat! Get ready to make the Moon applaud for us too!"
