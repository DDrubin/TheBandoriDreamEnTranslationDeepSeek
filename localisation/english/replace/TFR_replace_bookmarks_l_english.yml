GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "Brave New World"
GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As the world entered the 21st century, new social landscapes began to form. Political transformations commenced as long-standing entities drifted further from their initial scope. The internet's ability to disseminate any form of expression to a global audience created new pockets within society. New and old conflicts were waged openly and diligently across vast oceans and over微不足道的线条微不足道的线条 (seemingly insignificant lines) on maps. Perhaps it was inevitable that the Earth would descend into chaos once more. Perhaps chaos itself is fleeting. This world's future is yours alone to decide."
FIRE_NAME: "§Y Light the Kindling §!"
FIRE_NAME_DESC: "The first nineteen years of the twenty-first century passed in a weave of turmoil and stability, yet now the international community faces its greatest predicament since 1991. The re-election of anti-establishment President Donald Trump seems likely, tensions in Eastern Europe and Asia are rapidly escalating, and extremism is stirring around the globe. The future of human civilization grows increasingly dim, and reports from China about a 'Novel Coronavirus' seem poised to add fuel to a world already piled high with dry tinder."
ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The EU is more unpopular than ever. The British people are quick to blame every ill of their nation on the officials in Brussels and the German government in Berlin. Public will on this issue is deeply divided. Although Britain has recovered well from the 2008 economic crisis, leaving the EU could undo the economic development of the past decade. Even so... is national sovereignty not ultimately more important than economic efficiency?"
FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "France faces growing social and political tensions amid economic difficulties and major terrorist attacks in Paris. Against this backdrop of turmoil, public attitudes towards Muslim and Jewish communities are becoming increasingly polarized. The nationalist party National Front is seizing this opportunity to try and gain greater political influence from the chaos.\n\nFacing this critical juncture, can France's democratic institutions and European integration withstand the test, or will France break free from its bonds and return to the glorious era of its independent and autonomous past?"
GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Germany is experiencing a refugee crisis, economic difficulties, and growing discontent towards countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain. Yet, despite these重重挑战重重挑战 (multiple challenges), Germany remains standing firm. Meanwhile, the EU is expanding southward, while Germany's policies are increasingly criticized by its neighbors.\n\nShould Germany continue on this path, upholding European unity, or should it re-examine old border disputes and set its armies marching once more?"
JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "In 2020, a global pandemic and economic crisis swept through Japan, dissolving social trust and intensifying political divisions. With the international order crumbling and traditional security barriers vanishing, Japan's future is filled with uncertainty. A cloud of unease hangs over the archipelago, with undercurrents of change surging powerfully.\n\nThe end of the old era has arrived. At this historical turning point, will chaos consume all, or will new forces rise from within to lead the nation towards an unpredictable destiny?"
ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Among the G7 nations and the four major European economies, no country was as deeply affected by the 2008 economic crisis as Italy. Economic recovery has been slow, and government support is constantly dwindling. The influx of African immigrants has also damaged the image of domestic stability in the hearts of the people. Italy needs to重新审视她的选择重新审视她的选择 (re-examine her choices). Now is clearly not the time for a revival of imperialism, but sweeping reforms will be inevitable..."
PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "China places great emphasis on not letting her enemies detect her weaknesses. Environmental pollution sticks in the throat like a fishbone, internal migration is out of control, military power is declining, and the Communist Party leadership remains perpetually corrupt. Yet, China remains the unassailable giant of the East, feared by all smaller nations. Japan, South Korea, rebellious elements in Taiwan, Vietnam... all are united in their hatred of China.\n\nAs tensions escalate, it becomes evident that China must confront these challenges head-on for the future."
RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "India's economy is growing rapidly, much like her population. Although still not receiving much attention on the international stage, the South Asian tiger is well-fed and roaring at the sky. India has embarked on a predatory campaign, and her prey remains unaware."
SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Like other Southern European nations, Spain was deeply mired in the 2008 economic crisis and required economic stimulus from Northern European countries. The 'Podemos' and 'Ciudadanos' parties brought new populism and new uncertainty to the old system. And today, the Catalan independence movement poses a greater threat to Spanish unity than ever before.\n\nThe path to economic recovery is long and perilous—will Spain remain in Europe to ward off the looming disaster, or choose a path different from that of the Northern European nations?"
SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the path back to glory for the Russian Federation was clearly fraught with twists and turns. Its institutions and economy were corrupt, its army large but obsolete, its political influence weak; Russia had to accept a decade on the margins. Now, it hopes to return to the center of the world stage."
USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Internal divisions are unprecedented; external challenges far surpass those of the Cold War. Clearly, America has long since sailed away from the golden age of unipolar dominance. The populace is deeply worried about China's offensive, increasingly anxious about industrial issues and economic hardships, and public support for American military alliances is waning. The next U.S. President will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on Earth and reshape the true meaning of the 'land of the free and the home of the brave'."
