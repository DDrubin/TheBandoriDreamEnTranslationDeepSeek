expo.1.t: "Revitalize the Osaka-Kansai Expo"
expo.1.d: "The Osaka Expo of 1970 was a brilliant event during the period of rapid economic growth in our country. It not only proved our prosperity in economy, technology, and society, but also provided momentum for further development, becoming an unforgettable memory together with the Tokyo Olympics. However, times have changed. With Japan’s economic decline, not only was the second Tokyo Olympics full of struggles, but also the second Osaka Expo, which we began to host in November 2018, faced great difficulties. With the outbreak of civil war, the plan came to a complete halt, and its failure seemed inevitable.\n\nHowever, we cannot give up this opportunity. If we can restart the construction of the Osaka Expo halted due to the civil war and complete it smoothly, it will inject a strong boost into our war-torn economy and prove to the world that this is the evidence of our nation’s revival! Now, with only two to three years left until the scheduled opening date of April 13, 2025, as long as we pull ourselves together and work hard, we can definitely complete it perfectly and once again unite people in this turbulent world, allowing everyone to look to the future again.\n\nOur Minister of Internal Affairs, Satomi, volunteered to take charge of this matter because it is her hometown. After going through administrative procedures and legal interpretation, we were able to redefine the duties of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and appoint her as the temporary Osaka-Kansai Expo Revitalization Commissioner. Now, in order not to let down people’s expectations, Satomi has resolved to do this well."
expo.1.a: "Everyone, for Osaka, for Kansai, for Japan!"
expo.2.t: "The Commissioner from Osaka"
expo.2.d: "Inside Osaka City Hall was utter confusion. Since the central government in Tokyo announced the restart of the Expo plan, Osaka had been living each day between celebration, doubt, and indifference. Even though the plan had begun, the local government, severely damaged by the civil war, had no strength to carry out construction. Voices calling for more funding from the central government grew stronger. But when Osaka Prefecture and City requested such support, what arrived was not only resources and funds, but also a young commissioner they did not expect—perhaps even too young. Of course, considering the Tokyo ‘girls’ government was already very young, this wasn’t surprising.\n\nThe newcomer was none other than Ushigome Satomi, born in Osaka, now serving simultaneously as Minister of Internal Affairs and the Osaka-Kansai Expo Revitalization Commissioner. Osaka City Hall prepared a short but warm welcome ceremony for her—not too resource-consuming, since they couldn’t afford it. Satomi arrived dressed in a light pink formal suit, awkwardly and shyly accepting the welcome, taking commemorative photos with important officials and city council members. Journalists’ cameras captured the strange but interesting moment of a girl commissioner standing among adult officials, secretly delighted that this would surely become a headline.\n\nDuring the Expo construction period, Satomi would likely spend about two-fifths of her time in Osaka, while the other three-fifths would be in Tokyo, continuing her duties as Minister of Internal Affairs and coordinating Expo work with the central government.\n\nAfter the welcome ceremony, during the following banquet, Kansai’s political and business leaders came to toast her. She used tea instead of alcohol, accepting both sincere and superficial greetings. “Commissioner Ushigome is from Osaka, so at least she must be truly sincere about this, right?” said the president of a construction company, with others nodding in agreement. “Commissioner Satomi will definitely achieve great things—after all, she’s Osaka’s daughter!” “Yes, yes, let’s drink to the success of the Expo!”\n\nSatomi’s hand trembled slightly as she raised her teacup. Never in her life had she been under such attention. With her face flushed, she said to everyone: “Since everyone trusts me this much, I’ll definitely……” Satomi realized she had spoken in Kansai dialect, but seeing that everyone around her were fellow Kansai people, she continued, “I’ll do my utmost for the Osaka Expo! I’ll solve all the problems for everyone! I’ll make sure the Expo is completed perfectly!” The adults laughed, “That’s right!” “We’ll definitely prosper—get rich!” Having said so many bold words, Satomi suddenly felt shy, muttering to herself: “I wonder if I can really do it… I mustn’t let PPP down……”\n\nBut she also heard faint sighs: “If that little girl doesn’t ruin the Expo, it’ll already be good enough.” This saddened her, and she silently lowered her head. Yet she remembered what Saaya had told her before departure: “Little Satomi, there will definitely be people against you, but don’t lose heart. Remember, PPP will always be behind you.” A firm light flickered in her eyes. After a moment’s silence, she raised her head and declared—"
expo.2.a: "Please rest assured, everyone, I will succeed!"
expo.3.t: "The Osaka-Kansai Expo Successfully Held!"
expo.3.d: "Today, Yumeshima Island in Osaka Bay is bustling, as the opening ceremony of the Osaka-Kansai Expo is being held there. For the second time in history, Osaka has gathered the latest achievements representing humanity’s future, with visitors from around the world eager to feast their eyes.\n\n“Little Satomi, I knew you could do it!” Kasumi hugged Satomi, rubbing against her. Satomi blushed, smiling shyly: “Well, it’s only because of everyone’s support that I was able to succeed.” Hearing this, Saaya smiled gently: “Little Satomi is speaking in Kansai dialect again.”\n\n“Ah! Did I really……?” Satomi said embarrassedly after leaving Kasumi’s embrace. “So what? Just speak freely, Satomi,” Arisa waved her hand with a smile. “This Expo is meant to showcase Kansai’s charm to the world! How could our Minister of General Affairs be shy about her Kansai dialect?” Tae nodded, “Exactly. I’ve never been shy about loving rabbits either.”\n\n“Everyone—” Satomi’s eyes turned slightly red as she looked at them, “These days, I was constantly worried I’d fail, bringing shame to Osaka’s people. But because everyone supported me, I was able to keep going!” While smiling, she wiped her eyes, saying, “It feels like a dream, just like when I was writing a song for my sister’s birthday—back then too, everyone supported me……”\n\nSaaya looked at Satomi gently: “But now, we’ve accomplished something even greater together. Not just the audience, but the whole nation, the whole world—” “They’ve heard our voices! Our star’s heartbeat!” Kasumi shouted, raising her arm, “Kirakira dokidoki!” Arisa facepalmed helplessly, but smiled: “Hey, calm down. Still, we really did what we never thought possible before.”\n\n“Yes, just like stars shining together, we too showed our light to everyone,” Tae concluded with a smile. The Expo venue was still packed. On the grounds, a new small special pavilion had been built, introducing how Minister Satomi was entrusted during a time of crisis as Osaka-Kansai Expo Revitalization Commissioner, step by step turning a hopeless plan into success. Not by supernatural powers or a mysterious guitar—though perhaps a little—but by her and everyone’s enduring hope for the future, down-to-earth hard work, and deep love for her hometown.\n\nSatomi looked at PPP again, her eyes reddening: “It doesn’t feel embarrassing to speak in Kansai dialect anymore. I’m proud I was born in Osaka. I yearned for change, to become a better version of myself, to see more beautiful scenery. That motivation, my love for my hometown, and everyone’s support in Popipa led me here today. And after this, I won’t have to rush back and forth, I can spend more time with everyone in Tokyo. So I want to say……” She looked at her smiling friends, took a deep breath, and spoke slowly—"

expo.7.t: "Meeting with Kansai’s Political and Business Leaders"
expo.7.d: "Since the central government directly took over Expo construction and decided to bring in outside companies, during a roundtable meeting with Kansai’s political and business leaders, Satomi listened to wave after wave of complaints without showing even a formulaic smile. A construction company president was the first to ask: “Minister Ushigome, what does Tokyo mean by this? Dropping in a minister to interfere, and now taking away Kansai people’s livelihoods too?” “That’s right, those Kanto folks just want a share of the profits, don’t they!” “Cancel this decision, at least report it back to them!”\n\nSatomi frowned tightly and said, “Everyone, I understand your dissatisfaction. But in this period of national post-civil war reconstruction, we must work together to overcome difficulties. After evaluation, our cabinet believes outside companies are necessary for the Expo to be completed smoothly.” A middle-aged man stood up angrily: “Minister, do you mean you don’t trust us!? This Expo is supposed to carry the mission of reviving Osaka and Kansai. If outsiders take away the jobs and orders, what will we do?” Another chimed in: “And you are from Osaka yourself, how could you not put your hometown’s interests first?” The roundtable instantly descended into quarrels, dissatisfied voices filling Satomi’s ears, making her face pale.\n\n“Everyone!” Satomi suddenly raised her voice, startling all present into silence. Trembling slightly, she continued, “This Expo does not only belong to Osaka and Kansai, but to Japan and the whole world. If we only think of Kansai’s interests and forget that this Expo is for the world, then it is doomed never to—succeed!” Her unusually passionate words, so unlike her normally gentle style, quieted the room. Though some were shaken, no one could be entirely swayed by one speech. In the silence, someone whispered, “But we can’t just sit back and watch companies from elsewhere, especially Kanto, steal all the business, can we?” “Yes, and how will Kansai citizens think? They see you as Kansai’s daughter, they feel close to you. Wouldn’t this destroy the image you’ve built with them?”\n\nCalming down slightly, Satomi replied, “This decision isn’t mine alone to make, as you all know. But if necessary, I’m willing to take responsibility. Even if everyone dislikes this policy—” Taking a deep breath, she declared firmly, “I will make sure this Expo succeeds! Not only for Osaka and Kansai, but for Japan as a whole!” The leaders present saw an unprecedented determination radiating from the girl minister they once thought weak, and were surprised. After a pause, one asked: “Then what about the issue of our local companies……”\n\n“Rest assured, in the government’s bidding process, you will have a place.” While speaking in political language, Satomi felt her heart pounding from the earlier passion, a little embarrassed and incredulous. But she continued, “Local revitalization is also a key focus of our government’s work this time. We will not ignore Kansai’s people and businesses.” Whispered discussions followed. Though unsatisfied with such vague promises, they knew they had no alternative. “That’s good, then,” one said, and others nodded silently.\n\nSatomi finally breathed a sigh of relief: “Thank you all for your understanding!——”"
expo.7.a: "Gentlemen, please truly consider the interests of Osaka and the nation!"
expo.8.t: "Meeting with the Ishin Party"
expo.8.d: "At the Osaka headquarters of the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), both Ishin staff and Shiny Party Osaka branch staff were busily preparing for this important meeting. Sitting in the car, Satomi gazed outside, lost in thought about Tokyo. She recalled Arisa’s warning: “If Ishin proposes any ideas about local decentralization, especially the Osaka Metropolis concept, don’t respond or brush it off casually.” Clutching her suit skirt, Satomi thought: “Would the Osaka Metropolis plan really make life better for the people of Osaka?”\n\n“Minister Ushigome, we’ve arrived.” her secretary whispered. Satomi stepped out of the car and entered the Ishin headquarters. Her pink formal outfit seemed out of place in the building full of a stern, right-wing atmosphere. She was greeted by Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura and Osaka Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama. Nodding slightly, she was invited to sit. At the long table, members of both the Shiny Party and Ishin had already begun their work.\n\n“Minister Ushigome, since you’re from Osaka, we’ll skip the formalities—that’s not the style of us Kansai people.” Yoshimura began, “We Ishin won’t oppose the Expo’s restart, but to be honest……” He glanced at Yokoyama, who nodded and said, “We don’t know how much meaning this really has, or how much good it will bring Osaka and Kansai. After all, this Expo is led by your Shiny Party that came out of nowhere, not us Ishin.” Satomi knew what they meant—they feared their demands would be ignored by the Shiny Party government.\n\n“Governor Yoshimura, Mayor Yokoyama, your concerns are understandable,” Satomi said, looking them in the eye. “Regarding the integrated resort and casino issue, the central government knows Osaka’s finances are strained, and we will bear most of the funding.” She sighed inwardly, waiting for their response. “That’s good to hear! Your direct local funding subsidy policy is useful,” Yoshimura smiled. Yokoyama nodded, “That way it benefits both sides.”\n\nSo, was that it? Although Saaya had reassured her this meeting wouldn’t be too difficult, she didn’t expect it to be this simple. Just as Satomi was about to relax, Yoshimura spoke again: “Minister Satomi—if I may call you that—since you’re from Osaka, I’m sure you understand the inefficiency of Osaka Prefecture and City’s dual administration, right?” Satomi nodded helplessly; of course she knew. Yoshimura continued, “As a Kansai native in the Kanto-based central government, could you not fight for more benefits for us Kansai?” Arisa’s warning echoed in Satomi’s mind, and as she was about to deflect with some vague official words, Yokoyama spoke up.\n\n“Just look—the Expo inefficiency is tied to this dual administration! Two governments mean two sets of procedures. If the ruling parties differ, it’s even worse! But if the ‘Osaka Metropolis’ plan is realized, removing this defect, Osaka will have a brighter future!” Satomi wavered. She truly wanted her hometown to improve and thought the Osaka Metropolis concept wasn’t necessarily bad. But Arisa’s words came back: “They make it sound good, but in reality it’s for the political-business elite, not ordinary citizens.”\n\nSeeing her hesitation, Yoshimura smiled: “Of course, you don’t have to answer now. I know this stance may not be welcome within the Shiny Party, but please think carefully. As for the Expo, Ishin will fully support it.” Relieved, Satomi stood, bowed slightly, while staff began tidying the meeting notes. With mixed feelings, she said—"
expo.8.a: "Thank you for your understanding, Governor Yoshimura."
expo.9.t: "Returning to Tokyo"
expo.9.d: "Satomi boarded the Shinkansen back to Tokyo, watching the passing scenery with countless thoughts. Since becoming Minister of Internal Affairs, she had already accomplished much. But she knew only working locally wasn’t enough. She resolved to return to Tokyo and speak with the central ministries overseeing the Expo—the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Prime Minister’s office. “At least this time, I’ll see familiar faces……” Having dealt constantly with unfamiliar adults had been stressful for the shy and introverted minister, so she felt relieved about this trip.\n\nFirst, she went to meet the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Kokoro Tsurumaki. Yes, the same Kokoro always full of wild ideas. With her usual bright smile, Kokoro said: “This Expo will definitely make everyone around the world smile more and more! I support it! Satomi, ask for whatever you want!” Satomi laughed awkwardly: “Ah, I don’t need much—” Beside her, Misaki, exasperated, cut in: “That’s enough, Kokoro. Let’s talk business with Minister Ushigome.” Satomi breathed a sigh of relief—Misaki was reliable as always. After agreeing on many matters with the five of HHW, Satomi walked out of METI exhausted, got into the car, and headed to the next destination. “Minister, the Prime Minister went to the presidential residence, we need to adjust the schedule,” her secretary reminded her. Satomi nodded with eyes closed—she just wanted to rest a little.\n\nAt the presidential residence, she entered the office and found unexpected faces—not only Arisa and Kasumi, but also Saaya and Tae. “Satomi, welcome back,” Arisa said, her tiredness no less than Satomi’s, but she still forced a smile. Satomi nodded and sat down. Surrounded by everyone like this reminded her of her carefree student and band days, gradually melting away her exhaustion. They discussed Expo affairs for hours, then slipped into PPP’s familiar chatter.\n\n“Satomi, are you tired?” Arisa asked. After hesitating, Satomi nodded: “Yes, even my consumption of Choco Cornets has gone up. But I can’t stop now.” She sighed. Saaya, smiling, pulled out a bag of Choco Cornets: “So I specially prepared a bag just for Satomi! Everyone, no stealing!” Satomi’s eyes lit up as she grabbed one and ate happily: “Thank you, Saaya!”\n\n“Hey, Saaya, what about us?” Kasumi pouted. Saaya laughed, pulling out another bag full of bread: “This is for everyone else.” Tae said thoughtfully: “Saaya is like a bread Doraemon, pulling out every kind of bread.” “Ahaha……” Saaya scratched her head shyly. Arisa, watching Satomi happily eating her Choco Cornet, smiled with fond exasper
