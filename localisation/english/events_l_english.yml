bgd.1.t: "Shining Party Established"
bgd.1.d: "After going to war with the Self-Defense Forces, in order to better help Kasumi achieve her dream of “shining brightly, making hearts flutter,” Arisa resolved to establish a new political party, just like the adults. This party absorbed all the girls’ band members Popipa had met and formed deep friendships with in the past, but adults who supported their ideals under the influence of the mysterious guitar were also indispensable. Arisa would become the de facto leader and policymaker of the party, but in name, the party head would be Kasumi.\n\nIn the Circle, everyone was having a meeting to decide the party’s name and political program.\n\n“Let’s call it the Rabbit Party,” Tae said seriously. “Haha, nobody would understand that,” Saaya said awkwardly. “How about the Bread Party instead~~” Moca suggested casually. The discussion became chaotic, and finally Arisa couldn’t stand it anymore—\n\n“Everyone, take this seriously!” After thinking for a moment, Arisa looked at Kasumi. “Eh, Arisa, I think calling it the Shining Party would be good! Because it’s so sparkly and radiant!” Kasumi said with a bright smile. “Not bad, it reflects our political program,” Yukina said seriously. “I-I support Kasumi’s opinion,” Mashiro raised her hand timidly. “It really makes people smile!” Kokoro laughed in support. Then everyone agreed one after another. Arisa sighed: “Fine, fine, since everyone says so……”\n\nIn the end, the meeting decided on the party name—Japan Shining Party."

bgd.2014.t: "The Dream That Never Ends"
bgd.2014.d: "Finally, after going through so many things, our dream withstood the test and reached a perfect conclusion.\n\nWe were once just a group of innocent, naive girls, chasing our own dreams, never imagining someone would deliberately try to destroy them. When the Self-Defense Forces staged a coup and that shining dream dimmed, we nearly fell into despair. But with the help of the mysterious guitar, we finally stood up, defeated the SDF who sought to destroy people’s hopes, and led the entire nation down a path we had never dared to imagine. That path was extremely difficult, yet so heart-stirring that we had no choice but to pursue it.\n\nOn this road, we encountered countless hardships: opposition and struggle from the Democratic Front, sabotage and attacks from far-right remnants, material collapse and social decay after the civil war, and the looming threat of the East Asian State... The heavy pressure weighed on every member, especially on the leading Poppin’Party. Everyone, even Kasumi, had moments of despair, feeling the task was impossible.\n\nYet we continued to pursue our shining dream, believing it would bring infinite possibilities, believing the future would be endlessly heart-stirring. It was this spirit that allowed everyone in the Shining Party to fearlessly push forward to the very end. And with the support of all the people, who also dreamed because of our promises, we gained infinite strength. The dream may have been awakened by the mysterious guitar, but more importantly, we always had it within us—it had only been dormant in our hearts.\n\nFinally, the East Asian State, another nation influenced by supernatural power but one that awakened the darkness in humanity, launched an attack on us. But by then we had the determination and strength, and had already realized many beautiful dreams. We resolved never again to let anyone destroy our dream and destiny. All those with hope in their hearts united, overcame fear, and faced the unseeable monster head-on, striking at its heart. The monster collapsed, and our skies cleared, revealing a double rainbow.\n\nIs this the end of the dream? No, the dream never stops; there will always be new dreams to chase. Dreams belonging to everyone, dreams belonging to oneself, will never halt. The road of dreams will stretch on, forever. And now, we can finally proudly shout—"

bgd.1212.t: "Tokyo Military Coup!"
bgd.1212.d: "After the recently elected Leftist Alliance refused to intervene in the Taiwan Strait war, the enraged Self-Defense Forces joined with Japan’s far-right forces to launch a military coup! SDF armored vehicles and tanks rolled into Tokyo, with soldiers patrolling and blockading the city. However, for the SDF it was already too late. Because the coup was only hastily planned after the Leftist Alliance’s decision not to intervene in Taiwan, there had been no proper preparation. Furthermore, a significant portion of the Ground Self-Defense Force opposed the coup and tipped off the government, warning them. The coup descended into chaos. Most members of parliament and leftist party members escaped Tokyo and halted in northern Japan, reportedly planning to form a new government to resist the SDF.\n\nJapan has been devastated by crises in recent years, society extremely fractured, finally reaching this point. No one can predict how events will unfold next, but one thing is certain—this will profoundly affect Japan and the future of the region."

news.1212.t: "Tokyo Military Coup!"
news.1212.d: "Japan’s political situation worsened and radicalized rapidly after the Leftist Alliance was elected, finally reaching its peak recently. According to international news, the SDF and far-right groups staged a coup against the current Leftist Alliance government, claiming the government had “betrayed national interests, betrayed the Japanese people, and become puppets of the Chinese government.” The real reason, however, was the government’s refusal to intervene in the Taiwan Strait war. Yet, countless videos shot by Tokyo citizens and widely circulated on social media showed SDF soldiers hesitating to follow orders or looking utterly confused. The SDF appeared unable to properly control the situation after the coup. State media and TV stations were seized by leftists to broadcast anti-SDF messages, coup videos spread online, and many strategic locations nationwide remained uncontrolled.\n\nThe cause was that a large portion of the Ground Self-Defense Force strongly opposed the coup, obstructing it and warning the government. Furthermore, the coup was only hastily conceived after the government’s non-intervention decision, making it chaotic from the start and giving MPs and leftist members time to escape Tokyo. The Leftist Alliance has now fled to northern Japan, where they are forming a new government and vowing to resist the SDF."

bgd.11.t: "Kasumi Toyama’s Melancholy"
bgd.11.d: "Tokyo, this vast metropolis, is under martial law. Citizens’ travel is strictly limited, soldiers patrol everywhere with live weapons, and checkpoints are set up. Kasumi walked along the street toward the Circle, dazed. Memories resurfaced—at the warehouse, when Kasumi insisted on performing at the Circle, Arisa scolded her: “The streets are full of SDF! Think about your own and everyone’s safety!”\n\n“Kasumi-chan, maybe don’t go……” Rimi said. “Yeah, Kasumi, you know there can’t be any audience at the Circle these days,” Saaya said. “Better to go home and see your rabbit,” Tae said seriously.\n\nAfter everyone left the warehouse, Kasumi looked at them dispersing, tears welling up: “Why, can’t we perform together anymore?” A stubborn force pushed her toward the Circle. “Will anyone go there?” Memories of performing with her friends appeared one by one. For the first time since birth, Kasumi felt this hopeless. Even though it was still within curfew hours, she walked cautiously.\n\n“Why do the adults have to do this? Why can’t we shine together with our dreams……”\n\nThinking as she walked, she saw the Circle—or rather, the collapsed roof of the Circle. “What happened to the Circle?” Without thinking further, she rushed inside. There, she discovered a passage leading underground. Feeling her way forward, deep inside, something was glowing—"
bgd.11.a: "“So strange”"
bgd.12.t: "The Mysterious Guitar"
bgd.12.d: "Kasumi had been missing all night, and Arisa was frantic. “Kasumi, where the hell did you go!?” she shouted in vain. Arisa mobilized all her fellow girls’ bandmates to search, but as the sky darkened, everyone shook their heads in resignation.\n\n“Let’s go back and wait for news,” Chisato said helplessly. “But!……” Arisa still didn’t want to give up, until Sayo interrupted: “I know you’re worried, but it’s getting dark, and curfew is about to start. We can’t keep searching……” Arisa stood still, fists clenched, and ignoring everyone’s surprise, ran off again to keep searching.\n\n“Kasumi, Kasumi!” While searching, she tripped and fell to the ground. Supporting herself up, her vision blurred. Was she captured by the SDF? Or some other bad people? What would happen to Kasumi in their hands?......\n\nAt a loss, suddenly her phone rang—it was Kasumi calling. Arisa answered anxiously, not waiting for Kasumi to speak: “Kasumi, where are you!?”"
bgd.12.a: "“Eh, I’m at the Circle”"
bgd.13.t: "An Ancient Place?"
bgd.13.d: "“W-what is that?” Arisa asked, looking at the mysterious ancient-style guitar in Kasumi’s hands. Arisa had led the group of searchers to the Circle, where they found Kasumi holding this guitar.\n\n“Over here!” Kasumi waved with a smile, leading them through a dark cavern. “This is just a dead end?” Arisa asked, facing a massive stone gate carved with strange patterns. “Watch this!” Kasumi lifted the guitar. “So shiny!” Arisa fell backward. As the guitar glowed, the light gathered and struck the circular pattern in the gate, which rumbled open.\n\n“Wow!……” Everyone gasped as they entered. In the vast space stood a gigantic stone stage. “Such a big stage!” Hina exclaimed. “Amazing!” Hagumi looked around. “Then, where’s the Circle?” Saaya asked in disbelief. “Up those stairs, and there it is!” After climbing, through the collapsed ruins of walls, the Circle’s stage stood before them."
bgd.13.a: "“Arisa, let’s hold a live!”"
bgd.14.t: "Let’s Hold a Live!"
bgd.14.d: "“A live? Here?” “That’s right, let’s do it!”\n\n“How did you even find this place?” Himari asked in shock. “She told me!” Kasumi pointed at the guitar in her arms. “Everyone, let’s perform a live together!” “In this empty place?” Misaki said awkwardly.\n\n“I always felt someone was calling me—she and this place must want a live just like we do.” Kasumi turned to everyone. “Because here is… so sparkling!”\n\nHer eyes shone like stars as she strummed the guitar. Everyone was captivated by the enchanting sound, silent for a long time before speaking.\n\n“Not bad,” Ran said, winking. “Alright, let’s do it!” Aya’s face lit with expectation. “I’m getting excited already!” Kokoro cheered. Finally, Yukina declared: “It’s decided—”"

bgd.15.t: "A Bold Plan"
bgd.15.d: "The performance at the Circle attracted many passersby, and soon everyone moved to the streets. The mysterious guitar seemed to have a power to inspire people—whoever heard its sound felt a surge of indescribable passion and love for life. Even the performing girls couldn’t stop wanting to keep playing. The cheering crowd swarmed around them, and more and more people were drawn in by the guitar’s magic—soon over ten thousand. Even as night fell and curfew began, soldiers could not stop the surging crowd. Facing the deafening cheers, the SDF dared not fire; some soldiers, upon hearing the music, even joined the ranks.\n\nWherever the girls went, more and more people joined under the moonlight. Eventually, an endless-looking procession formed. Kasumi stood before them, strummed the guitar, and the crowd fell silent. In the quiet night, the music sounded slowly. The SDF could no longer stop the crowd; soldiers unwilling to resist joined too. Arisa stood beside Kasumi, striking the keyboard, and amid the people’s brief cheers, dozens of band girls began to play. In Arisa’s heart, a bold plan was born……"

The garrison was either forced to retreat or joined the citizen militia. Amid the chaos, a citizen army opposing the SDF suddenly emerged, seized key points across the city, captured大量 weapons, and drove the SDF out. While the SDF command was confused, Arisa stood beside Kasumi, who was about to give a speech to the citizens—"

bgd.18.t: "People’s Union Wins Election"
bgd.18.d: "Japan’s politics have undergone a major upheaval. The LDP has once again lost power. Over the past two years, the pandemic, oil crisis, and financial crisis have severely damaged Japan’s economy and society, and the LDP’s mismanagement failed to resolve them. The public grew deeply disappointed. Many ordinary Japanese sank into economic hardship, with living standards falling sharply. Leftist calls for fairness and justice gradually gained traction.\n\nThe pursuit of social fairness and justice pushed the People’s Union’s policies and propaganda further to the left, giving its internal left-wing “social faction” the upper hand. The Constitutional Democratic Party candidate, jointly nominated by all People’s Union parties, was elected Prime Minister. He promised to implement left-wing policies announced during the election and declared Japan would not intervene in any overseas conflicts. Japan’s political future may soon be dominated by the left."
bgd.18.a: "Toward a better tomorrow!"
bgd.9.t: "Promise to the People"
bgd.9.d: "We have defeated the LDP. Though in postwar history leftists defeated the LDP twice, both times they soon failed, the LDP returned, and the leftist parties dissolved. This time, we will not repeat those mistakes. We will not compromise with the right again, or we will tread the same path of failure. We promise the people we will build Japan into a permanently peaceful, prosperous, and fair nation, leaving no one behind.\n\nThe right will surely resist fiercely, but only by facing this monster that has dominated postwar politics can we hope to win."
bgd.9.a: "The right will not stop us!"
bgd.36.t: "Tokyo Military Zone Established"
bgd.36.d: "After the Tokyo coup, to better manage the massive city, the SDF military government decided to establish a military administrative zone in Tokyo, and propped up the previously defeated LDP as a puppet civilian government to assist in management. Martial law has been declared, restricting citizens’ travel. Although violent clashes by leftists and far-leftists opposing the coup broke out in Tokyo, and some even threw Molotov cocktails at the SDF, the SDF ultimately suppressed them with ruthless efficiency.\n\n“Can we still perform at the Circle, Arisa?” Kasumi asked worriedly, her cat ears drooping. Arisa crossed her arms, frowned, and shook her head."
bgd.36.a: "No matter what, holding a live is impossible now……"
bgd.34.t: "Some SDF Units Defect"
bgd.34.d: "As the SDF prepared to attack Tokyo, videos of the girls’ bands performing with the mysterious guitar spread wildly among front-line SDF troops. Soon after, units originally meant to suppress Tokyo declared rebellion, defected, and joined our side, along with the territories they controlled. Arisa’s gamble proved correct: the guitar indeed had an inspiring—perhaps even bewitching—supernatural power. However, its strength is steadily weakening. In more distant regions, its effect is fading. We must act quickly before it loses power. The SDF will not abandon their attack plans. As for the guitar, what exactly its mysterious power is, how it works, and whether it will diminish, remains to be studied carefully."
bgd.34.a: "What will this supernatural power bring?"
bgd.31.t: "Join the Front"
bgd.31.d: "After the SDF attacked us, the Democratic Front sent an invitation to form a military alliance, jointly resisting the SDF threat. Of course, we agreed. The adults of the Democratic Front called us a “democratic force opposing military dictatorship,” and welcomed us warmly as part of the leftist camp.\n\nIn their view, once the civil war ends and the SDF is destroyed, Tokyo will surely be absorbed by them. But we don’t think so. Despite the current common threat, in the future, conflict over Japan’s fate will inevitably erupt between us."
bgd.31.a: "Bring freedom and peace back to Japan!"
bgd.38.t: "Kasumi’s Speech"
bgd.38.d: "After the street performance’s great success, a bold plan formed in Arisa’s heart—she couldn’t bear to see Kasumi and her friends lose their smiles. The culprit, the SDF, had to be driven out. “This isn’t the time to hesitate! You think you can just perform and leave? The adults won’t allow it!” With these words, Arisa convinced the others. She also had a hunch: the mysterious guitar seemed to have unknown power. If used properly, nothing was impossible. But first, they had to organize the citizens to resist the SDF. The SDF’s control in the city was collapsing, and many adults, influenced by the guitar, supported them. With these adults’ help, a citizen militia was ready to rise. Arisa prepared a speech for Kasumi to deliver to the passionate citizens.\n\n“Eh, Arisa, I know, don’t push me, I’m still nervous—” Kasumi was shoved onto the stage prepared by the adults. At the end of her speech, she said: “Let’s all strive for a sparkling, heart-stirring future! We all have the right and chance to pursue our dreams! I declare the founding of the Tokyo Freedom Front, opposing SDF military dictatorship!”"

news.1213.t: "Democratic Front Formed"
news.1213.d: "After the Self-Defense Forces overthrew the elected government, most members of the former government eventually announced the formation of a Democratic Front in the north, with its headquarters in Sapporo. At the public meeting for the formation of the front, its members collectively condemned the SDF coup as 'illegal and unconstitutional, a violation of the will of the Japanese people, lacking public support, and doomed to fail.' They demanded the SDF immediately return power to them, threatening to restore the nation's democracy and order by armed force otherwise. However, the SDF issued a similar response, stating that 'traitors will face the harshest judgment unless they immediately lay down their arms for possible leniency,' and issued a fourteen-day ultimatum. If the Democratic Front did not surrender before the deadline, the SDF would immediately launch an attack.\n\nClearly, the Democratic Front could not accept such demands. They had coordinated with relevant anti-SDF forces, begun assembling arms, and accepted some defecting SDF personnel. Meanwhile, the SDF quickly moved troops to Japan's northern border. Undeniably, a Japanese civil war seemed almost inevitable."

The SDF fired the first shot, marking the full outbreak of the Japanese civil war. Although the SDF currently holds the advantage, no one can predict the ultimate victor. The SDF faces resistance in its rear areas, while the Democratic Front controls the relatively underdeveloped north with less sophisticated weaponry.\n\nThis will be a war determining Japan's fate and future. Both sides are determined to fight to the end, which will cause immense destruction to Japan. Due to the rapid and massive changes, neither side was fully prepared for a total civil war. International observers and military experts predict the war will not be decisively concluded quickly, likely becoming prolonged and highly destructive.\n\nCountless Japanese people watch in horror as their country is consumed by war.

Just as we joined hands with the Democratic Front to defeat the SDF, the situation underwent a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Democratic Front believed they would unquestionably control the nation's future direction post-war. However, we now control territories far exceeding theirs, surpassing them militarily, economically, and in popular support. The people call for peace, hoping the two former allies can merge peacefully to build a new nation together. This is the public will; neither side can resist it.\n\nThus, the only question was who would lead this unification. We negotiated with the Democratic Front late in the war, and the adults, yielding to our advantages, agreed to a peaceful unification under our leadership. Now, with the joint declaration of peaceful unification, long-lost hope ignites in people's hearts—Japan's future sets sail from here."

Millions have lost their homes, the economy is in shambles, and residual far-right elements, unwilling to accept defeat, continue to resist. Lives are devastated; dreams and hopes are shattered.\n\nThis tragedy should never have happened. If not, perhaps Kasumi and her friends would still be happily performing live at Circle. But it was the discovery at Circle that changed everything. That mysterious guitar united people, ignited passion in their hearts, and ultimately led us to victory.

news.1215.d: "Strange and shocking news arrived: the Japan Glitter Party—a faction that emerged only after the Japanese civil war—swiftly ended the conflict, unified the nation, and avoided the prolonged war many had predicted. More astonishingly, their leaders are just a group of teenage girls. Their leader, Toyama Kasumi, addressed the nation and the world, stating she would bring 'glitter and excitement' back to this war-torn land.\n\nThis is a stunning turn of events. The Glitter Party first allied with the northern Japan Democratic Front to eliminate the Japan Self-Defense Forces, then achieved a merger with the Democratic Front under their leadership. They started as a civic movement in Tokyo opposing the SDF's military dictatorship. Japan has begun reconstruction and constitutional conventions, but the situation is grim. The civil war displaced millions, utterly destroyed the national economy, and residual far-right resistance persists.\n\nInternational observers and governments worry whether a group of girls has the capability to govern a nation.

Coupled with global chaos and the impact of our civil war, already scarce industrial raw materials became even more scarce, making it difficult for most factories to operate. Businesses were forced to lay off workers or go bankrupt.\n\nGrocery shelves are empty. Connections between many rural areas and cities have weakened, causing food supply difficulties. External food imports are still recovering—but chaos in the US, China, and Southeast Asia makes this difficult. Some even call this the second 'Rice Riots.'

The sex industry has rapidly expanded as some women in difficult circumstances join.\n\nNow, to survive, people have placed morality secondary.

We also received reports that far-right resistance forces are coordinating with gangsters to oppose us.\n\nTherefore, the SDF's elimination does not mean the far-right has ceased.

This may seem impossible, but such efficient organization might be thanks to the ancient guitar found at Circle. It united people, supported our leadership, made our thinking more active, and our dreams firmer. This guitar turned the impossible into possible.

Although Kasumi didn't understand and suggested not disturbing the old man, Arisa held her back. The convention agreed on this resolution, which will undoubtedly provoke opposition from residual right-wing forces and even confusion among moderate citizens. But this is the first step toward rebirth.\n\nWe decided to retain the previous multi-party parliamentary democracy system, a move most citizens can accept and welcome, and the liberal democratic system we rebelled against the SDF to defend. However, the specific design of the polity isn't entirely unchanged. We will establish a multi-party parliamentary democracy freer and more democratic than the previous regime, truly reflecting the people's voice.\n\nThe new constitution establishes a unicameral parliament. The National Assembly will become the supreme state authority and legislative body. Electoral districts use proportional representation. The President directly appoints the Prime Minister, subject to parliamentary approval. The Prime Minister proposes cabinet members, and after presidential approval, forms the cabinet. The Prime Minister and cabinet are responsible to the parliament. The President holds diplomatic, defense, and some executive powers. Many believe Kasumi will serve as President, though perhaps as a figurehead, while Arisa will likely be Prime Minister, controlling the overall situation and reform plans behind the scenes.

In this situation, even the left-wing Democratic Front, strongly opposed to constitutional amendment, must compromise to ensure national defense security.\n\nThe new Article 9 will retain our right to 'defensive war' and allow developing defense forces based on this.

Preliminary estimates suggest an unprecedentedly high turnout because the civil war forced most people usually indifferent to politics to focus on the political arena. The public hopes to ensure post-war Japanese politics can lead national revival without further division. Thus, an astonishing number of people are going out to vote for those they believe can revitalize the nation.\n\nThe Glitter Party Election Strategy Committee, responsible for PasPale members, has launched a nationwide propaganda campaign.

Although the Democratic Front has begun treating us as another LDP, causing cracks in our relationship with these adults... this cannot stop the glittering dream from blooming across Japan!\n\nThe new government's cabinet and minister list is drafted. Simply put, Poppin'Party governs, overseeing overall situation and diplomacy; Roselia and Raise A Suilen handle defense and military; Afterglow and HelloHappyWorld manage economy and labor; PastelPalettes handles propaganda and culture; Morfonica handles intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, many adults assist our governance—some career bureaucrats, some experts in various fields, some adult members of the Glitter Party. Adults support us for various reasons: believing in our dreams, self-interest, going with the flow wanting stability, etc. Regardless, the overall situation is set. Those doubting our success will be proven right or wrong by time.\n\nThis election was an interim election. After discussions and compromises with various forces, we decided the next formal election would be in 2025, following the previous regime's 2021 election. This means our current term is incomplete because many citizens and parties distrust our ability. To avoid disaster from failed governance during a full term, we compromise by testing the girl government's capability with this incomplete term. Failure could be mitigated due to the short term. But we are confident in proving our ability to the people, gaining public trust through governance achievements. We will surely succeed!"

bgd.42.d: "Today, the National Reconstruction Committee officially began work. Popipa members walked on the shopping street. Although undamaged, it was desolate; past customers had disappeared. Shop owners looked worried. 'Just breaking even is good enough now,' a shop owner uncle told them.\n\n'People have no money or energy to come here anymore, and shops struggle to source raw materials,' Arisa said frowning. 'Then, can we still buy choco coronets?...' Rimi asked uneasily. 'Don't worry, little Rimi, my family will still prepare some for you, and Mocha too,' Sāya smiled comforting Rimi, 'but, it's quite勉强 (hard) too.'\n\n'The shopping street is like our home,' Kasumi said sadly. 'So many glittering things happened here! We performed here together! But everyone's gone now...' Tae looked at the deserted street and nodded: 'I really want to participate in the shopping street culture festival again. Want to bring the rabbits too.'\n\nSeeing everyone dejected, emotions surged inside Arisa. Remembering past laughter on this street, feelings of nostalgia and不甘 (unwillingness) grew stronger. Arisa stepped before everyone, blushing, and said to the puzzled companions—"

The shopping street, and indeed all Japan, have largely returned to their former daily appearance. The shopping street crowd has increased again; shop owners are beaming.\n\n'Shopping street, everyone, we're back! We really succeeded!' Kasumi laughed, spreading her arms, unable to contain excitement. Arisa sighed beside her, smiling helplessly: 'Kasumi, remember to return on time. We can't just do whatever we want like before now.' Mentioning this, Arisa felt another wave of loss. Since the civil war began, everyone rarely had time to play together. Heavy work made her increasingly worry if everyone could still be like before—impossible already...\n\n'Reconstruction work completed very well. Let Kasumi and everyone enjoy themselves today,' Sāya persuaded. 'Rimi wants to eat choco coronets too, right?' Rimi smiled excitedly nodding: 'Yeah, choco coronets!' Since reconstruction began, Rimi's choco coronet consumption during work seemed high.\n\nHowever, Tae seemed thoughtful. 'What's wrong?' Arisa asked. 'Arisa's atmosphere is different than usual, like my rabbits when unhappy,' Tae replied seriously, chin in hand. 'What kind of比喻 (metaphor) is that!' Arisa exclaimed.\n\n'Eh, Arisa, is that so? If something's wrong, you can tell everyone,' Kasumi looked at Arisa worriedly. 'It's nothing. Seeing the shopping street like before is really great.'\n\nEveryone continued walking, but Kasumi turned back, smiling at Arisa: 'It's great everyone can be together like before again! Not just us, many people returned. Everyone will be together, always, always, creating more glittering, exciting things! This time, it's about realizing dreams with all citizens! Arisa, let's do it together!'\n\nEveryone smiled and nodded, chattering. Arisa was stunned but gradually felt reassured and relaxed. With companions by her side, surely they wouldn't separate, wouldn't fail, right? She relaxed and smiled: 'Really can't handle you all. Only today is allowed for play! Tomorrow, work continues!' Speaking, she glanced at guards hidden in the shadows—some things have changed, like these extra guards."

bgd.56.d: "The constitutional convention's first day concluded perfectly, probably—Arisa sighed, preparing to leave the venue. 'Where did Kasumi go?...' She and other members looked around while walking. 'Kasumi seems over there,' Tae suddenly said. Following Tae's direction, Popipa members saw Kasumi talking with a Democratic Front adult.\n\n'Little girl, do you have experience governing a country? Wouldn't citizens feel more at ease if we took over?' Facing such an adult, Kasumi seemed flustered: 'Eh, is that so? Then... but we have confidence too, please believe us! We'll bring glittering dreams to the citizens!' The adult sighed: 'What glittering dreams? Citizens need full stomachs and security now, need fairness and justice, to...'\n\n'Please rest assured, we are a mature political party, otherwise we wouldn't be standing here with you,' Arisa's voice interrupted the adult. 'The issues you mentioned are also our concerns. We will complete these matters methodically.' The adult looked at Arisa, frowning: 'How do you ensure these aren't empty words?' Sāya smiled responding: 'The parliament can supervise our work and question the government. These channels should satisfy you. Citizens will choose based on the government's performance, right?'\n\n'You've learned bureaucratic talk,' the adult said helplessly. 'Fine, let the citizens choose then.' Seeing they couldn't win against the group, the adult left. Rimi looked at Kasumi worriedly: 'Kasumi-chan, are you okay?' Kasumi smiled shaking her head: 'No, I'm fine. Just feel we still have much to learn.' Despite saying so, Kasumi's face showed a trace of worry. 'I really want to go back and see my rabbits,' Tae said listlessly too.\n\nArisa looked at the somewhat downcast group, feeling不甘 (unwillingness) rising inside. Do those adults look down on us just because of age? Is our civil war contribution denied because of age? Arisa raised her head, saying firmly to everyone: 'Everyone, don't worry, I will definitely do the work well. Won't let those adults look down on us!' Everyone's expression gradually firmed.\n\nAfter a while, Kasumi looked at everyone, smiling again: 'Then everyone stretch out hands and cheer together! Popipa, pipopa, popi...'"

Just as China won the Taiwan Strait war, and the world thought the East Asian situation would clarify, its capital suddenly lost contact with the globe. After brief chaos, a group of previously unknown leaders announced the land of former China is now ruled by 'Eastasia,' quickly controlling the capital and major cities nationwide.\n\nThis is an utterly illogical turn. In China, freshly unified and developing vigorously, suddenly an unknown political force stages a coup and gains national control—this is extremely shocking and puzzling. Nations and think tanks worldwide are racking brains analyzing China's astounding incident but can't deduce reasons or conclusions.\n\nThis has severely impacted Asia-Pacific geopolitics, even if the world doesn't know what Eastasia's leadership plans. Their rise sparked various online speculations globally, some even suggesting supernatural forces or alien interference.

The army head requested more funds, claiming if we want to defeat Eastasia eventually, it must rely on the army; the army is the ultimate winning service.\n\nNavy: Always our development focus. To avoid maritime invasion, we need a powerful navy. The navy head also said the navy is irreplaceable for future blockades and assisting coastal attacks against enemies. More importantly, the navy protects our crucial sea lanes as an island nation. 'Frankly, ladies, if we lose sea transport, we're finished,' the navy head said.\n\nAir Force: Advanced air force is key to ensuring land and sea superiority and protecting our homeland from bombing. The air force head claimed with air superiority, his army and navy colleagues would win easily. Thus, 'rather than investing in army/navy, invest in us, killing three birds with one stone,' were the air force head's exact words.\n\nYukina closed her eyes, recalling each service head's words.

Other Japanese far-left forces, including Trotskyists, united to form the Japanese Revolutionary Workers' Party, gaining increasing support among workers, progressive students, and intellectuals.\n\nMore concerning are far-right forces, split into two groups. One waves the 'Revere the Emperor, Expel the Traitors' banner, forming the Revere the Emperor, Expel the Traitors Party, strongly opposing our abolition of the Emperor system, intending to restore it violently. The other established the Japanese Nationalist Combat Alliance, promoting 'Japan as a divine nation,' vowing to create a single-ethnic Yamato nation, proclaiming Yamato ethnic superiority and uniqueness, internally divided into fascist and neo-Nazi factions. These far-right forces contacted SDF remnants; the three are coordinating and cooperating.

APFNO and SCDA, the two most representative, diametrically opposed mega-military alliances of the post-Cold War era, have finally erupted into an all-out war that sweeps across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nEastasia's aggressive ambitions prompted it to instigate North Korea's southward attack on South Korea, and its declared next target after conquering South Korea is the invasion of the Japanese archipelago. Japan, representing APFNO, announced it would fully defend the independence and sovereignty of all countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Although all nations foresaw the inevitable outbreak of this war, its scale remains unimaginably vast. From the Himalayas to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, and the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan Strait regions, the armies of both sides have begun the largest war of this century.\n\nThe international community has widely shown support for APFNO, condemned Eastasia for instigating North Korea to start the war, and imposed a large wave of sanctions against it. However, given that the world is busy with its own affairs, the war affecting the future fate of the Asia-Pacific will still be determined by the strength of APFNO and SCDA themselves.

Eastasian troops have already massed on its borders with neighboring countries, and small-scale conflicts have begun to erupt. Eastasian military actions have alarmed its neighbors, who have protested these troop movements. However, Eastasia stated that the premise of protecting the security of surrounding countries is that its own territorial and border security is prioritized, and they will eliminate all unstable factors affecting this.\n\nSome of the most pessimistic predictions suggest Eastasia is about to launch a large-scale military invasion of its neighbors. Eastasia has been noncommittal on this. When asked about this, Japan's foreign spokesperson said: 'We sincerely hope Eastasia will do more things conducive to regional peace and stability, rather than forming exclusive military alliances while continuously provoking neighbors.'

Japan has sent invitations to countries around Eastasia, hoping they can join APFNO, accompanied by large investments and high-level official exchanges. In response to Japan, Eastasia has increased patrols in the sea areas between the two countries, and aircraft frequently conduct reconnaissance and harassment of Japanese bases.\n\nMany countries worldwide have reacted to this. Europe welcomed the move and expressed hope to strengthen cooperation to ensure global peace and stability. Russia expressed concern about the 'Asian version of NATO' but also stated it would maintain an open attitude towards APFNO's future actions. However, one thing is commonly recognized by countries around the world—the establishment of APFNO is undoubtedly to counter Eastasia, and Eastasia will not accept this甘心 (meekly).

news.1223.d: "Myanmar's chaotic situation似乎 (seems) finally coming to an end, but not resolved by itself, but by an飞扬跋扈 (overbearing) external force—Eastasia. Eastasian troops have launched a full-scale出击 (offensive), attacking into Myanmar, which is in civil war. Eastasia claims this is to ensure the security of its southern border, and Myanmar's inability to resolve its domestic混乱局势 (chaotic situation) poses a serious threat to Eastasia's border. Condemnations and sanctions issued by Japan and its allies are of no avail.\n\nMyanmar's various ethnic armed groups, anti-government forces, and junta forces did not end internal strife to jointly resist the Eastasian invasion but continued to fight amongst themselves. This brings both convenience and added chaos to Eastasia's invasion of Myanmar. Myanmar has now become one of the most chaotic places in the world, with foreign invaders, ethnic armed groups, anti-government forces, and the junta fighting in a complete mess.\n\nSuch混乱的局势 (chaotic situation) and Myanmar's complex terrain lead many observers and military analysts to believe that even if Eastasia achieves victory on the正面战场 (frontline), it cannot effectively govern Myanmar. Myanmar will become a graveyard for Eastasia like Afghanistan and Vietnam. Others worry about the possibility of Eastasia adopting governance methods that ignore any local rights, such as massacres and expulsions. Regardless, Eastasia's military victory is certain, and how they manage this chaotic place is what everyone is concerned about."

bgd.72.d: "During the civil war, the LDP (Liberal Democratic Party) acted as a lackey for the SDF, kneeling before them, assisting them in establishing a puppet civilian government to装点门面 (window-dress) the SDF's military dictatorship and enhance their legitimacy. Now that the civil war has ended, the LDP is widely despised for its past actions and faces a huge political crisis.\n\nHowever, many right-wingers still support the LDP. The LDP also reacted quickly to the post-civil war crisis, re-electing Shigeru Ishiba as president. He is trying to lead the LDP out of this crisis. Now, many right-wingers and centrist citizens hoping for stability and order are being attracted by the LDP's new round of propaganda. The LDP is rapidly gathering a large number of right-wing forces to oppose our governance.\n\nSome among us believe that the LDP should be查封取缔 (sealed and banned) for the crimes committed during the civil war, terminating the right-wing's ongoing coordinated resistance and scattering the right-wing. However, others point out that while this would分散 (disperse) the right-wing, it would push many right-wingers who originally did not intend violent resistance towards the far-right forces. These far-right elements attempt to overthrow our regime by violent means, posing a greater危害 (threat) to national security. It would be better to tolerate the LDP's continued activities, at least ensuring their supporters don't become极端化 (radicalized).\n\nWhat should we do?"

After brief交火 (exchange of fire), the remaining enemy personnel were eliminated. They found the entity in one of the尚未被摧毁 (not yet destroyed) vehicles—a pitch-black cube-like object resembling a Rubik's cube, emitting刺眼的 (dazzling) light that constantly changed colors.\n\nPerhaps because our队员 (members) were influenced by the mysterious guitar, their minds were unaffected. The队员 (members) placed explosives on all vehicles and detonated them after moving away.

In subsequent confirmation,队员 (members) reported all suspicious items on site were destroyed, including the object carrying the supernatural power.\n\nSoon after, we witnessed大规模逃兵 (large-scale desertions) in the Eastasian army and全面起义 (full-scale uprisings) in the rear.

This has caused a轩然大波 (great sensation) among the affected East Asian populace.\n\nAccording to the Japanese government's disclosure, those who first discover these supernatural powers become their users and influencers. The supernatural power exists in two entities, one in Japan. Relevant researchers stated: 'The power existing in our country is positive and inspiring,它可以激发并强化人的诸多正面性格 (it can stimulate and strengthen many positive human traits), making them more optimistic and positive. But its influence range and intensity are lower. It does not have the power to manipulate minds.'\n\nThe other is in Eastasia, on the land of former China. Its influence intensity and range are enormous, covering the entire China. Specific information about it is not fully掌握 (grasped), but based on existing information, it implants fear, obedience, and weakens human will in the human mind, possessing近乎于操控人心的能力 (an almost mind-control ability). This power激发了 (stimulated) some people's desire for power and negative traits. They used this power to influence the entire country, leading to the rise of Eastasia.\n\nAnother piece of information is that people affected by one supernatural power are no longer affected by the other. Also, although both powers have physical entities承载 (bearing them) (Japan has revealed its entity is guitar-shaped; Eastasia's shape is尚未确定 (not yet determined)), their influence range is roughly fixed. No matter how they are moved, they cannot exceed their current influence range, but the influence intensity can still change at any time.\n\nAfter these revelations,人群反应各异 (crowd reactions varied). Although people in areas affected by supernatural power had大致确定 (roughly determined) its influence, the complete confirmation of its existence still caused some social动乱 (unrest). Panic occurred in both Eastasia and Japan. Eastasia tried to封锁消息 (block the news) but failed.\n\nThe report finally stated that this power might be some kind of ancient alien technology, but for now, it can only be called 'supernatural power' because its scientific principle is尚不清楚 (not yet clear). The current international community is concerned about what consequences this power will have and whether humanity can cope with it. Where will the fate of East Asia go because of it?"

Therefore, we began researching this power.\n\nAlthough still completely baffled for now, it can be确定 (determined) that Eastasia's rise is definitely related to supernatural power, and contrary to the supernatural power on our side, it is a negative power that caused it to堕入深渊 (fall into the abyss), and its ability is接近 (close to) mind control. The strength of our mysterious guitar's power is far less than it was initially when it could鼓动市民起义 (incite citizen uprisings) and entire SDF units to defect. Even now it still has强大的力量 (powerful strength) to influence minds, but it is more of an auxiliary force and cannot directly control minds.\n\nThese powers might be some kind of alien ancient technology? If there really is an alien civilization, we don't know why they placed this technology here, perhaps just for experimentation. Because the scientific principle of this power is currently unclear, we暂时将其称为 (temporarily call it) 'supernatural power'.\n\nThe supernatural power has physical entities承载 (bearing it); ours is that mysterious guitar.

But what is curious is that these bands are all composed of schoolgirls still in junior high and high school.\n\nEven though it's normal for classmates to form bands in school, these 'girl bands' entirely composed of少女们 (young girls) seem to be forming a社会现象 (social phenomenon). With their love for music and friendship, they play their own songs,掀起一股风潮 (stirring up a trend) across the country. Currently, our country and the world are facing huge crises. Joking remarks甚至 (even) appeared online, saying that if the current government is unable to solve problems, perhaps these band girls should give it a try.\n\nWhen Live Houses across the country are packed with people enjoying the girls' music, it represents an optimistic and positive spirit still singing响亮 (loudly) in times of crisis. This spirit is undoubtedly good, but as the clouds of conflict and war gradually approach, it's hard to imagine how their lives will be affected. We only hope that these children's future won't be黯淡无光 (dimmed) by the difficult world situation, and they won't be被迫分离 (forcibly separated) from their friends due to war or other man-made disasters.

People挥洒青春 (spent their youth freely), lived life肆意 (unrestrainedly), and wrote their own chapters in the golden age of the economy. However, the economic bubble grew larger and larger, ready to burst with a gentle poke. Shortly after the Plaza Accord, Japan's golden age戛然而止 (came to an abrupt halt). Since then, a period known as the 'Lost Decades' began. Such times continued relentlessly. First, China surpassed our country, and Germany surpassed us again after our civil war. It似乎 (seemed) the glorious past was just a crazy and虚幻的梦 (illusory dream), and we were destined to live in the shadow of the past.\n\nBut we were not吓倒 (deterred) by such困境 (difficulties). Inspired by dreams, we began a new round of efforts. And now, we can proudly announce that the 'Lost Three Decades' have ended here! Our economy has welcomed another golden age! This is an unimaginable achievement, but we did it. We created a prosperous economy again. Moreover, the new economic system will truly benefit every citizen, allowing them to freely chase their dreams without worries.\n\nOur country is expected to return to its former position as the world's second-largest GDP. Many ambitious people even propose aiming for the world's number one spot. After all, the US had a civil war, Europe is constantly in conflict, and Eastasia's way of developing its economy won't be as good as the previous Chinese government's. Now, the Glitter Party is receiving unprecedented and widespread support in society, its popularity soaring. Indeed, economic work is the best way to prove our决心 (determination) and实力 (strength).\n\nHowever, how long will this economic prosperity last this time? Many cautious economists and older generations who experienced the bubble burst have raised this question. No economy can prosper forever. The golden age we created with our own hands will probably end one day like before, right? Everything has an end, but the end is not可怕 (scary).相反 (On the contrary), it will be a new beginning. New beginnings always excite us. Each time on top of the old end, we will create a higher achievement. Just like after the despair of the Japanese civil war, everyone built a better future.

Ever since she had embarked on this path, there was no turning back, was there?\n\nThis massive reform plan, even with the help of many supporters, was a difficulty Arisa had never encountered in her life before. \"Giving up is impossible, right...\" Arisa muttered to herself.

She always only thought about Poppin'Party, but was governing the country for her own selfish desires?

We have pushed constitutional amendments to the final step, and soon the new constitution will be passed. In the new constitution, the President is granted broader powers; now the Prime Minister and cabinet are directly appointed by the President without requiring a parliamentary vote of confidence, and the Prime Minister and cabinet are now responsible to the President; the President holds diplomatic and defense powers, and is also granted supreme executive power; the Parliament cannot impeach the President, but can only remove the cabinet with a two-thirds majority; meanwhile, the Parliament retains many important powers such as legislative and budget review powers; among other constitutional amendments.\n\nThose former Democratic Front parties have criticized our constitutional amendments for pushing the country onto the path of authoritarianism and personal dictatorship. Other parties and some segments of society have also expressed concerns about the authoritarian politicization of this amendment. Our party, of course, disagrees with their views.\n\nIn response to these criticisms and concerns, and to assure the general public that our politics remain democratic, just more efficient, we have taken the following measures: strengthening the independence of the judicial system; establishing independent oversight bodies inside and outside Parliament; adding clauses to the constitution to limit excessive concentration of presidential power and interference with individual freedoms; promoting civil society participation in politics, strengthening cooperation with civil society, advancing citizen participation in political discourse, establishing institutionalized citizen oversight of the government, increasing citizen political enthusiasm; establishing multiple official online platforms for citizens to monitor the government and actively participate in political discourse, building digital democracy; and many other measures. These measures will surely ensure democratic oversight and checks and balances while allowing efficient administration and smooth policy promotion, allowing our country's proud democratic system to continue developing.\n\nIn short, a reformed presidential system has now been born, both efficient and democratic.

Silvery moonlight shone into the room. She started scrolling through her phone, seeing Kasumi's new message getting more and more comments and likes. Although there were opposing voices in the comments, more were people's friendly and亲近 (affectionate) comments, and someone jokingly replied: \"Be careful of the ghosts from the February 26 Incident too.\" Arisa finally made up her mind and began editing a slightly boring but completely self-written new message: \"Had a pleasant day today. Good night, everyone.\" Then she pressed send."

bgd.89.t: "Kira Party Faction Rise?"
bgd.89.d: "After we took power, all sectors of the country focused on the political changes within the Kira Party. Recently, society and opposition parties simultaneously started the narrative of 'Kira Party faction politics taking shape,' believing we, like the LDP, follow Japanese political traditions, and that the party has already differentiated into different factions and interest groups. Of course, we don't call this change faction politics because the band members have always been united! We call it the 'Great Girls Band Alliance.' However, what they say isn't entirely wrong.\n\nWithin the Kira Party, based on the original bands, different 'Policy Research Associations' or similar groups have formed. Each band and its vocalist, based on the理念 (philosophies/ideals) from their band activities, developed different political ideas and policies on how to build and reform the country. Our different bands each have their strengths. If we can utilize and implement the policies proposed by each band well, we can better complement each other and develop the country.\n\nThe Kira Party has always been united, with no need to worry about the hidden dangers of factional分裂 (splits) and斗争 (struggles). Just like every instrument's sound is indispensable in a band performance, listening to everyone and every band's voice, playing a harmonious sound, let's build the Kira Party and the Republic better!"

bgd.90.d: "\"Your country should understand, we are not here to take advantage of the situation.\"\nKasumi's voice echoed in the venue, carrying an unusual gentleness, yet with an undeniable firmness.\n\nThis was already her third closed-door negotiation with Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Portnin. The sky over Bern was overcast, the shadow of war spreading from Western Europe over the Alps, yet Japan's young president, with a warm smile and an exceptionally detailed blueprint for island economic development, was quietly changing the map of the Far Eastern border.\n\nRussia couldn't care less about the Far East now.\nSince the war began, the Kremlin had invested almost all its elite forces in the European direction. The crisis on the Western Front forced them to make compromises in the East—even for the Kuril Islands, which they hadn't loosened their grip on for a hundred years.\n\n\"What we propose is a mutually beneficial agreement.\"\nArisa补充 (added), her document reading: \"Total consideration: 8.5 billion A-Dollars, energy contract extension for ten years, port assistance reconstruction fund totaling 1.2 billion A-Dollars.\"\n\"Furthermore, we承诺 (promise) not to launch any form of political or military action against the Russian Far Eastern border during the Continental War.\"\n\"And can secretly provide medical supplies to Vladivostok.\" Tae said softly.\n\nPortnin's face was expressionless. He knew this was Japan's opportunity, Russia's wound, but also a straw Russia had to grasp. Stability on the Eastern Front in exchange for breathing room on the Western Front was the only argument he could use to persuade the Duma and the generals now.\n\nAfter a long silence, he pressed the fingerprint confirmation device. He just said in a low voice:"

bgd.91.d: "Tokyo. The Ministry of Finance press room was packed. Japan, having experienced civil war and reconstruction, eagerly awaited signals of economic recovery. Today, Finance Minister Yamabuki Saaya would announce the highly anticipated economic stimulus plan.\n\nSaaya, in a smart suit with the Kira Party's star badge on her chest, stood at the podium. She announced the launch of the \"New Japan Revival Plan,\" aiming to build a prosperous and inclusive economic system to support reforms and allow citizens to pursue their dreams.\n\n\"We will adopt a series of active macroeconomic调控措施 (control measures),\" Saaya's voice was温和 (gentle) yet坚定 (firm). \"First, lower the benchmark interest rate to encourage investment and consumption.\"\n\n\"Second,\" she continued, \"we will implement quantitative easing.\" Facing the stir in the room, she explained candidly: \"This is not blind money printing, but targeted asset purchases to inject liquidity into the market, ensuring funds flow to the real economy, especially innovative, green, and workplace democratization enterprises.\"\n\nTo help everyone understand better, she used an analogy: \"It's like ensuring the 'dough' gets to the 'bakers' who truly need it, to make more good 'bread.'\" The atmosphere eased slightly.\n\nSaaya emphasized that strict regulation, fiscal coordination, and完善 (improved) welfare would be supporting measures, aiming for sustainable growth, not a短暂虚火 (short-lived false boom). Finally, she quoted President Toyama Kasumi's slogan \"Kira Kira Doki Doki,\" expressing determination to overcome difficulties.\n\nThe press conference ended. Prime Minister Ichigaya Arisa approached, quietly reminding her to prepare for public opinion challenges. Saaya nodded,深知 (knowing well) the hard battle had just begun. New Japan's economic engine, carrying the dreams and responsibilities of the girls, had officially started on the road to revival."

Her meticulously designed \"New Japan Revival Plan\" aimed to guide funds towards the real economy and innovative industries through interest rate cuts and quantitative easing, to rebuild prosperity. However, reality was both laughable and cryable (难绷 - hard to bear).\n\nLarge amounts of hot money did not滋润 (moisturize) manufacturing or high-tech as expected, but instead flooded into speculative areas like retro game cartridges and virtual idol NFTs. A news flash on the screen showed a company's stock price hitting the limit up仅仅 (merely) because of a vague tweet by some internet celebrity. \"What does this have to do with fundamentals?\" Saaya rubbed her temples, feeling like a baker束手无策 (helpless) against失控酵母 (runaway yeast)—intending to bake healthy bread, but the market 'yeast' blew up countless fragile speculative balloons.\n\nArisa walked in with tea, looked at the screen, and said sarcastically: \"Which lucky one did 'Mr. Market' randomly pick today?\"\n\n\"Don't say anymore,\" Saaya said with a bitter smile. \"We used tools that理论上 (theoretically) can regulate the economy, but it feels like trying to tame a wild beast with a small stick. Our analysis reports are less useful than an emoji?\" This sense of powerlessness in the face of the \"invisible hand\" dancing随意 (casually) made her deeply frustrated.\n\n\"This is the market, Saaya.\" Arisa's tone was heavy. \"What we can do is try to set up guardrails, adjust the direction, and pray it doesn't overturn the entire stall.\"\n\nDespite being难绷 (hard to bear), despite feeling powerless, the work had to continue. Arisa patted her shoulder: \"Meeting tomorrow to泼冷水 (pour cold water) on overheated sectors. At least we're still trying to make the bread taste better. Cheer up, 'Baker' comrade.\"\n\nThe office lights were bright, illuminating their tired but determined faces. Outside the window, Tokyo slept.

She sat in the Pastel*Palettes seating area, with Aya, Hina, Maya, and Eve beside her casting looks mixed with surprise, worry, and encouragement.\n\n\"Me?\" Chisato's first thought was this. Her? Shirasagi Chisato, former child prodigy, current idol band Pastel*Palettes' bassist and de facto operations core, now going to be responsible for the regional economic development of the entire Japanese Free Republic?\n\nThis wasn't as simple as adjusting an MV's budget or planning a tour route. The wounds of the civil war were not yet fully healed. Although preliminary reconstruction under the Kira Party's leadership was complete and infrastructure was beginning to function again, she now had a personal understanding of the term \"百废待兴\" (a hundred things wait to be done). Regional development was extremely unbalanced, many old industrial chains were broken, and new economic growth points were still unclear. Not to mention the Kira Party's proposed \"workplace-democratized, high-welfare capitalism\"—it sounded beautiful, but how to implement this ideal concretely in different regions, the complexity and difficulty involved, she could foresee with her toes.\n\nToyama Kasumi on the stage was looking at her with her characteristic, infectious smile, her eyes full of complete trust.\n\nChisato slowly took a breath and gently exhaled. She was used to the spotlight, used to presenting the most perfect side in front of the camera, and used to handling各种棘手的事务 (various棘手 thorny matters) behind the scenes. Staying calm and professional was her instinct.\n\n\"Regional economic development...\" she默念 (murmured) in her heart, her fingertips unconsciously lightly tapping the table. This burden was heavier than imagined. But since it was the choice of the nine-band union, Kasumi and the others' trust, she, Shirasagi Chisato, had no reason to退缩 (shrink back).\n\nShe stood up, bowed slightly to the podium and all representatives, her voice calm but clear: \"I understand. Thank you for your trust. Regarding the specific planning for regional economic development, I will promptly consult with Minister of Finance Yamabuki and relevant colleagues and submit a preliminary plan to the President and the Congress.\"\n\nNo bold statements, no excessive modesty. The usual Shirasagi Chisato style.只是 (Just), beneath her professional calm, a heart belonging to a pragmatist had already begun to beat faster for this new and arduous challenge. She knew this would be the most complex and important \"job\" she had ever taken on."

bgd.94.t: "The Southern Sunlight Road"
bgd.94.d: "Shirasagi Chisato's special plane landed in Kyushu, marking the official start of the Kira Party government's focused attention on the economic development of the southern region. The south has ample sunlight and a good agricultural foundation, but some areas have a single industrial structure, with the scars of civil war and long-term development滞后 (lag) coexisting.\n\nChisato did not choose to issue remote commands from the center but personally led her team, spending weeks深入 (deeply immersing) in Kagoshima's farms, Miyazaki's fishing ports, and some old industrial areas in Kitakyushu facing转型困难 (transformation difficulties). She found the people here hardworking and simple, but lacking modern technology, funds, and effective organization to participate in the market competition.\n\nIn an agricultural prefecture dominated by citrus cultivation, facing slightly bewildered farmer representatives, Chisato did not talk空谈理论 (empty theory) but directly proposed a pilot scheme for the \"Sunshine Orange Wind Cooperative.\" The plan included not only introducing improved varieties, promoting water-saving irrigation and green pest control technology but, more crucially, emphasized democratic management within the cooperative—from production plans to profit distribution, members would have greater say and decision-making power. She also contacted Foreign Minister Hanazono to preliminarily explore the possibility of exporting high-quality agricultural products to other member states of the \"Asia-Pacific Free Nations Alliance.\"\n\n\"President Kasumi's 'cultural utopia' is not a castle in the air,\" Chisato said calmly during a video conference with Finance Minister Yamabuki Saaya, looking at the brilliant southern sunlight outside the window. \"It needs a solid economic foundation and更需要 (even more needs) everyone to find dignity and value in their work. The revival of the south must start here, letting every labor be bathed in sunlight, letting workplace democracy truly blossom and bear fruit.\"\n\nHer plan was practical and detailed. Although challenges were重重 (numerous), it had quietly sown seeds of hope in this long-silent land."
bgd.94.a: "Press the advantage, roll out comprehensively"
bgd.95.t: "The Giants' Turn"
bgd.95.d: "The central region, the industrial heart of the Japanese Free Republic, with skyscrapers standing in great numbers and large enterprise group headquarters scattered everywhere. Unlike the pastoral revival of the south, Shirasagi Chisato faced deeply entrenched traditional business giants and complex industrial chains here.\n\nFinance Minister Yamabuki Saaya was drawing lessons from Roosevelt's New Deal, implementing a series of macroeconomic调控政策 (control policies)—strengthening financial regulation, investing in public works, and attempting to guide overly concentrated capital. This provided a微妙 (subtle) backdrop for Chisato's negotiations with large enterprises.\n\nChisato's goal was direct and bold: to promote \"workplace democratization\" into the interiors of these behemoths. She met with the chairman of a historically influential general trading company. The other party was polite but expressed skepticism about changing the existing efficient hierarchical management model,暗示 (hinting) it might weaken corporate competitiveness.\n\n\"Chairman,\" Chisato's tone was calm but不容置疑 (brooking no doubt), \"Minister Saaya's new policies aim to build a more resilient and domestically-driven economy. This means that future corporate competitiveness will stem more from innovation capability and employee initiative, rather than单纯 (simply) scale and traditional efficiency.\"\n\nShe then proposed a compromise: select a well-performing subsidiary of the trading company as a pilot, implement employee representatives participating in some operational decisions, and establish a profit-sharing plan linked to performance. \"This is not about颠覆 (overthrowing) management,\" Chisato explained, \"but transforming employees from mere雇佣对象 (objects of employment) into共同参与者 (co-participants) in the enterprise. I believe this can激发 (stimulate) their greater potential to cope with the increasingly uncertain global market in times of change.\"\n\nThe atmosphere at the negotiation table was tense at times. But Chisato knew that Saaya's macroeconomic controls were gradually changing the rules of the game; pure profit至上主义 (supremacism) was being challenged. Finally, after multiple rounds of博弈 (game theory/contest) and Chisato's precise interpretation of policy details, the chairman cautiously nodded, agreeing to a \"small-scale尝试 (attempt).\"\n\nAlthough it was only a slight loosening, for Chisato, it was the first crack chiseled into the central region's ice. The turning of a giant dragon often begins with the slightest adjustment in posture."

bgd.96.d: "When Shirasagi Chisato's black official car drove through the Aomori Tsugaru Plain, the apple blossoms had not yet bloomed, and the air carried the unique chill of early spring. Unlike the bustling central region and the recovering south, the vast northern lands seemed to hold an economic chill more persistent than the seasonal one. Population loss, aging, and the困境 (plight) of traditional agriculture and fishing were the realities before her.\n\nThe core of this trip was to promote a comprehensive development plan called the \"Northern Sustainable Ecosphere.\" This involved not only technological upgrades for existing agriculture and fishing, introducing the \"workplace democratization\" cooperative model, but also utilizing the abundant forest and geothermal resources of Hokkaido and Tohoku to develop eco-friendly energy and生态旅游 (eco-tourism).\n\nIn a temporary meeting room renovated from an old elementary school, local representatives of agriculture, forestry, and fishing had varied expressions—some expectant, some deeply skeptical. An old fisherman, speaking with a thick accent, said bluntly: \"Chisato-sama, we folks have lived off the sea all our lives. Can those new tricks you mentioned put food on the table?\"\n\nChisato nodded slightly, not changing her expression due to the other's directness. She called up prepared video materials—success cases from the southern \"Sunshine Orange Wind Cooperative\" and some shorts about developing eco-tourism and community sharing economies in cold regions abroad.\n\n\"Old sir,\" her voice was clear and steady through the microphone, \"I understand your concerns. 'Sustainable' means we cannot只看眼前 (only look at the immediate). Through scientific farming and fishing planning, we can let the ocean recuperate, ensuring more stable harvests in the future. And eco-tourism lets more people understand and cherish our northern nature and culture, which itself can create new value and employment.\"\n\nShe did not描绘空泛的蓝图 (paint vague blueprints) excessively but focused on specific support policies, the feasibility of technology introduction, and how to guarantee the short-term income and long-term well-being of local residents during the transition. Her camera sense and expressiveness as a former top idol were now transformed into a precise and persuasive communication art.\n\n\"The goal of the Kira Party,\" Chisato concluded, \"is to let the potential of every piece of land serve the people living there. The snow of the north can nurture life; the wind of the north can also turn the windmills of hope.\"\n\nOutside the meeting room, the cold wind依旧 (still) blew, but inside, some initially furrowed brows seemed to relax quietly in the practical prospects Chisato had描绘 (depicted)."

But those familiar with her knew the精明 (shrewdness) gleaming in her half-squinted eyes.\nUehara Himari, Director of the Internal Security Supervision Bureau, responsible for national internal security review and anti-subversion work.

Under the direct order of Minister of Justice Misora Ran, the Metropolitan Police Department's Special Execution Force, led by Commander Udagawa Ba, had cordoned off this shrine that enshrines so-called 'heroic spirits,' including Class-A war criminals.\n\nThe Glitter Party government had long made it clear that it would not tolerate any form of fascist revivalism or glorification of war crimes. After emergency deliberation by the 'Committee for Settling War Crimes' and a final ruling by the Supreme Court, the memorial tablets of those war criminals with blood on their hands were to be permanently removed from this place that distorts history.\n\nProsecutor Aoba Moka supervised the law enforcement process throughout, ensuring all actions complied with the legal procedures of New Japan. Director Uehara Himari was responsible for intelligence gathering to prevent any sabotage by extremists. Chief Justice Hazawa Tsugumi provided the final legal interpretation and basis.\n\nAccording to reports from the scene, with the assistance of professionals, those tablets symbolizing the specters of militarism were removed one by one. They will not be destroyed, for history should not be forgotten, but they are also unworthy of any form of 'enshrinement.' According to a special decree, these 'symbols' of the war criminals will be placed in specially designed eco-friendly containers and given a 'burial at sea' in a designated deep-water area of Tokyo Bay—letting the cold seawater thoroughly cleanse the sin and pain they brought to the world.\n\nThis move caused intense shock domestically. Some conservative forces and right-wing groups launched protests, accusing the government of 'desecrating heroic spirits' and 'betraying tradition.' But more supporters of the new regime, especially young people and progressive groups, took to the streets to support the government's decision, shouting slogans like 'Long live justice' and 'Settle historical accounts.'\n\nRan stated firmly at a subsequent press conference: 'This is not interference in any religious belief, but the execution of justice. Those war criminals who launched wars of aggression, bringing endless suffering to the people of Asia and the world, are unworthy of any form of commemoration.

Prosecutor Aoba Moka ensured the legality of the removal operations. Commander Udagawa Ba's Special Execution Force was deployed again to handle security during the removal process and prevent potential conflicts. The Constitutional Supervision Office led by Chief Justice Hazawa Tsugumi conducted strict legal reviews of every removal decision to ensure compliance with the spirit of the new constitution.\n\nIn central Tokyo, a notorious giant bronze statue commemorating the 'heroes' of a certain war of aggression was slowly hoisted from its base under the watch of the public. Supporters erupted in thunderous applause, shouting 'Down with fascism' and 'History must not be falsified.' Some older conservatives were heartbroken, viewing this as a 'betrayal of history.'\n\nRan stated at a press conference: 'These cold stones and metals carry twisted glory and insults to the victims. Their existence constantly reminds us of that dark era and could mislead our next generation. Removing them is not about erasing history, but about remembering history correctly.

Tae also actively communicated with victim groups in relevant countries, expressing the New Japanese government's sincerity in resolving this issue.\n\nFinally, the commission released a detailed investigative report, clearly acknowledging the crimes of the old Imperial Japanese Army in forcibly recruiting and enslaving 'comfort women' during WWII and expressing the deepest apologies to the victims and their families.\n\nSubsequently, the Republic government announced the establishment of a 'War Victims Compensation Fund.' The initial funds will be specifically used to compensate surviving 'comfort women' still alive and provide them with medical and psychological assistance. Simultaneously, the government pledged to include this history in textbooks, ensuring the younger generation learns about this dark chapter.\n\nThis measure received positive international反响, especially in Asian countries that had suffered deeply. Although some remnants of far-right forces domestically still decried this as 'masochistic historical view,' their voices seemed insignificant under the Glitter Party's strong popular support and the progressive social atmosphere.\n\nA survivor representative from South Korea, tears streaming down her aged face during a media interview, said: 'We have waited for this day for far too long...

In a solemn and respectful atmosphere, facing the monument engraved with the names of countless heroes who sacrificed their lives resisting Japanese aggression, the young Republic's President did something that shocked the world—she slowly knelt on one knee, expressing the most profound grief and deepest repentance to all victims of Japanese imperialist aggression.\n\n'We, New Japan, will never forget the lessons of history. For the unspeakable crimes committed by the old Japanese Empire, for the profound suffering inflicted upon your people, I, Kasumi Toyama, as President of the Free Republic of Japan, offer once again our deepest and most sincere apology.' President Toyama's voice, amplified, filled the square. Her eyes were slightly reddened, her tone filled with sincerity and sorrow. 'We pray for the repose of the deceased and that history will not repeat itself. New Japan wishes to join hands with South Korea to jointly create a future of peace and prosperity.'\n\nThis scene was broadcast live around the world. The reaction among the South Korean public was complex: there were elderly moved to tears, young people pondering in silence, but更多的是 appreciation for the young president's courage and hope for the future of bilateral relations. The international community also widely praised this move, seeing it as a milestone event where Japan truly breaks with its past and embraces peace.\n\nOf course, remnants of the far-right forces domestically were furious, calling it a 'national disgrace,' but their voices were quickly drowned out by the cheers of citizens celebrating a new chapter in bilateral relations."

bgd.104.d: "After unremitting efforts, under the leadership of Minister of Justice Misora Ran and her team—the members of Afterglow—the Republic's judicial reform has achieved a decisive victory. From the severe crackdown on corruption in the 'Secret Ledger' case, to the 'Battle of Attack and Defense' safeguarding cyber sovereignty; from the 'Drum Fury' cleansing criminal forces, to the 'First Constitutional Review' establishing constitutional authority—each step was imbued with their 'as always' determination and sweat.\n\nToday, the national spirit of the 'Glory of the Rule of Law' is deeply rooted in people's hearts. The law is no longer cold text but a warm shield protecting the rights of every citizen. The concepts of fairness and justice, like air and water, are integrated into the daily life of the Republic. Public trust in the government has reached an unprecedented high, social order is orderly, and crime rates have fallen to a historical low. People spontaneously maintain the peace of their communities and bravely say 'no' to unjust behavior. Throughout streets and alleys, scenes of citizens helping each other kindly are随处可见, an unprecedented sense of collective honor and responsibility permeates the entire nation.\n\nChief Prosecutor Aoba Moka recently complained somewhat 'boredly' because there are fewer and fewer 'interesting cases' requiring her personal involvement. Director of the Internal Security Supervision Bureau Uehara Himari was delighted to find that inflammatory rumors and sabotage activities have almost vanished. Police Commander Udagawa Ba can devote more energy to community service and crime prevention awareness. Chief Justice Hazawa Tsugumi of the Supreme Court witnesses the Republic's legal system becoming increasingly perfected, serving as a model for neighboring countries to learn from.\n\nToday, President Kasumi Toyama and the five members of Afterglow attended the 'Justice for All' commemorative event. In her speech, President Toyama highly praised Afterglow's outstanding contributions to the Republic's judicial cause and announced that the Republic has officially entered a new era of 'Justice for All.' In this era, every citizen is a guardian of justice, and every inch of land is bathed in the sunlight of the rule of law."

bgd.105.d: "A breeze from Beijing, carrying the faint chill of early autumn, swept across the empty square. The smoke of war had not yet fully dissipated, and a complex stillness hung in the air of this ancient capital. The grey memorial hall, bathed in the soft glow of dawn or dusk, resembled a silent colossus, crouching at the heart of history. \n\n‘Is this the place...’ Kasumi murmured softly, her gaze complex as she studied the building laden with so much historical memory. She clutched a bouquet of pure white flowers in her hand. \n\nYūki murmured, ‘Kasumi, are you certain about this? It will provoke immense controversy within the Alliance, indeed across our homeland. After all, he is...’\n\nIt was a fraught decision. \n\nMao Zedong, a figure who profoundly shaped twentieth-century China and world history, remains a subject of intense debate regarding his legacy both domestically and internationally. Their very presence here was fraught with contradiction and profound meaning. As victors, they could have dismissed this symbol of an old era's authority with disdain, even ordered its demolition. Yet Kasumi insisted on this visit. Kasumi gazed at the closed doors and the name still inscribed above the lintel. The air seemed to retain the lingering warmth of an era and the memories of countless people. Taking a deep breath, she knelt first, placing the bouquet gently upon the steps. No impassioned speech followed, only the wind whispering past her ears. Her gaze held no victor's pride, but rather a recognition of history's weight that transcended factions. This land had borne grand ideals and endured profound suffering. The five stood silent for a moment before rising, never looking back. Their figures vanished towards the far end of the square, leaving behind the white blossoms trembling faintly in the breeze. Together with the memorial hall, they became a profound footnote in the river of history.

Are you kidding me!\" She crossed her arms and turned her head away, striking a classic tsundere pose.\n\n\"Because Arisa is the most reliable!\" Kasumi leaned closer, her tone sincere. \"Besides, it's just in name! I've already asked Hina-senpai to handle the specific operations. She's the best at these large-scale projects and technology. Arisa just needs to come with me, representing the government for inspections and boosting morale!\"\n\n\"Just... in name?\" Arisa shot a suspicious glance at Kasumi, but hearing Hina's name made her feel slightly relieved.

These advanced devices, generously donated by the Tsurumaki Group, significantly accelerated the reconstruction process—clearly, Ojou-san Tsurumaki Kokoro had once again 'exerted' herself in her extraordinary way.\n\nWearing a hard hat, Kasumi excitedly pulled Arisa's hand, darting around the site. \"Arisa, look! The foundation for that building is already done! And over there, the road paving is so fast!\"\n\n\"I-I know! Don't pull so hard, you'll fall!\" Arisa stumbled, pulled along, her cheeks slightly flushed. The noise of the site seemed less harsh because of the vitality of the person beside her. Her hand was held tightly by Kasumi, the warmth from the girl's palm transmitting through thin gloves, making her feel a bit distracted.\n\nSuddenly, Kasumi stopped, turned to face Arisa, her bright eyes gazing at her seriously: \"Arisa, thank you. Having you here makes me feel so full of strength.\" As she spoke, she opened her arms and gave Arisa a solid hug, their hard hats knocking together with a soft *thud*.\n\n\"Wah! Wh-what are you doing, you idiot Kasumi! So many people are watching!\" Arisa was caught off guard by the sudden embrace, her whole body stiffening. Kasumi's familiar, faintly sweet scent enveloped her. Her heartbeat uncontrollably accelerated, *thump-thump-thump*, almost drowning out the roar of the machinery in the distance.\n\nKasumi let go but still held her hand, smiling like a child: \"Because being with Arisa feels just like Poppin'Party practicing a new song together, full of kira-kira doki-doki!\"\n\n\"Wh-what kira-kira doki-doki...\" Arisa lowered her head, trying to hide her burning face. Her legs felt weak, almost unable to stand. This idiot, always like this, using the most direct, purest way to easily break through all her defenses. She tried to pull her hand away, but it was held tighter.\n\n\"Arisa?\" Kasumi tilted her head, looking at her with concern. \"You don't look so good, are you too tired?\"\n\n\"N-no, it's nothing!\" Arisa forced herself to appear calm, but her voice carried a barely noticeable tremor. \"It's just... just too dusty here. Let's... let's finish the inspection quickly and go back.\" She felt that if this continued, she would really 'kirakira' faint right in front of this idiot.\n\nSunlight bathed the two of them, and the skeletal structures of the rising buildings behind them.

Reckless brinkmanship finally ignited the powder keg, as India and Pakistan dragged each other into a nuclear hell in a brief but devastating exchange. Tens of millions were vaporized in an instant, while more survivors languished in the wasteland of fallout, famine, and anarchy. The old governments were reduced to ashes, the order of civilization vanished, and this ancient land became a hunting ground for warlords, fanatics, and opportunists.\n\nMore dangerously, vultures are already circling. The East Asian State's AI core is coldly calculating the optimal path to swallow this chaotic land, aiming to incorporate its remaining population into its icy collective consciousness. We cannot allow the specter of totalitarianism to build a new cage upon the nuclear ruins.\n\nBased on the most fundamental principles of humanitarianism, and to prevent a catastrophic shift in the geopolitical balance, the APFNO has resolved to intervene. Led by the Free Republic of Japan, a large-scale intervention codenamed 'Operation Qilin' has been launched.\n\nSpearheaded by elite units of the National Defense Force, the alliance's fleets and transport aircraft are continuously heading towards the Indian coast. We bring not only arms but also medicine, purification equipment, food, and the hope of reconstruction. The alliance will establish an interim transitional government here, responsible for stabilizing the situation, decontaminating radiation, restoring production, and laying the groundwork for ultimately establishing a new India that is free, unified, and shares our values.\n\nPresident Kasumi Toyama addressed the world from Tokyo:\n\n'Even in the deepest darkness, starlight never extinguishes. Tragedy has struck, but human resilience and the yearning for freedom will outlast the nuclear fire.

The division of Thailand is now a foregone conclusion, with street clashes escalating into a melee between political factions. The Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office has compiled relevant reports and hereby provides a brief summary for you.\nFirstly, regarding the two main factions: primarily the royalist faction led by Maha Vajiralongkorn and the Thai People's Alliance government led by the Asia Libre Siam Command. Currently, Maha Vajiralongkorn and his supporters are gradually retreating to the Chiang Mai region, creating a stalemate with the pro-Japan People's Alliance faction on the southern coast; it is anticipated that the situation between these two factions will undergo a significant transformation following our military intervention.\nFurthermore, our International Intelligence Integration Organization indicates that the various Glitterism activities previously conducted in the Siam region have had a positive effect locally. This positive influence is expected to further increase public support for local Glitterist organizations among the populace. Currently, some Thai youth have already joined Glitterist organizations; the light of Glitterism has illuminated Thailand.\nThis change may herald the impending establishment of the Republic of Siam, which represents a significant advantage for our nation, particularly regarding the large-scale cultivation of local food and economic crops. This will provide more powerful support for the Glitter Party movement.\n\nSincerely,\nWith Respect."

Based on its regional stability maintenance obligations, Japan dispatched the 1st Escort Flotilla of the Japanese Maritime National Defense Force (flagship DDH-183 Izumo, including DDG-152, AOE-425, etc., with information support provided by the Federal Navy Peacekeeping Command, details in the appendix) from the Sasebo Base to provide rapid support in the Gulf of Thailand. The fleets of both sides confronted each other at the mouth of the Gulf. Thailand launched CM-302 missiles, which were intercepted by the Japanese Aegis system. During the operation, the Japanese submarine SS-501 sank two Thai vessels, and helicopters cooperated to destroy patrol boats PB-711/712. Among these, the achievements of the DDG-170 were the most outstanding; it used its MK41 Vertical Launch System to destroy five corvettes and one amphibious assault ship. Other achievements, after verification, should be attributed to the Takanami-class and Hatsuzuki-class vessels. Subsequently, the Navy of the Peacekeeping Command destroyed Thai missile positions and radar facilities and dispatched amphibious landing ships for landing operations. Due to supply shortages and casualty pressure, the enemy retreated.\n\nThis operation secured control of the Gulf mouth航道 (waterway) for the APFNO, essentially ensuring sea control. However, vigilance is still required against anti-submarine warfare tasks and attacks by small suicide boats.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary: Toyama Asuka\n[GetDateText]\n(Seal)\n\n― Note from the Cabinet Secretariat Measures Office ―"

Immediately after, the sky seemed to be gently brushed by an invisible giant hand. The originally gray, murky clouds dissipated, replaced by a perfect, deep azure. Sunlight, filtered through the invisible \"Hoshiori\" (Star Weave) energy field, became the softest, warmest golden beams, precisely stabilizing the temperature at a pleasant 26 degrees Celsius.\nOn the rooftop observation deck of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, Toyama Kasumi, Ichigaya Arisa, and Yamabuki Sae stood side by side, with Hanazono Tae and Ushigome Rimi, equally filled with excitement, behind them.\n\"We did it...\" Kasumi murmured, her eyes reflecting the new sky, her unique \"Kira Kira Doki Doki\" now seemingly materialized, merging with the heartbeat of all Tokyo. She didn't give a political speech. Instead, she turned around, grabbed the hands of Arisa and Sae beside her, and held them tightly.\n\"D-dummy Kasumi! So many people are watching...\" Arisa's cheeks instantly flushed crimson. She tried to struggle but was held even tighter by Kasumi. Her hand trembled slightly, unsure if it was from excitement or the familiar, comforting yet flustering warmth from the person next to her.

This sky was the crystallization of their arguments, dreams, and struggles.\n\"Our 'cake' is finally baked,\" Sae said, her eyes slightly moist.

The report directly accused the core leadership of the Japan Free Republic—President Toyama Kasumi and her four close cabinet members—of being involved in a certain \"systematic non-official collective activity.\"\nCiting internal anonymous sources, the report claimed that the real \"meeting\" only just begins after the official \"Policy Coordination Meeting\" concludes every Wednesday evening. The location is the heavily guarded basement level of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, jokingly referred to by the codename \"Small Office.\" This \"Overnight Special Meeting\" often lasts until dawn the next day.\nAn unnamed security official, speaking anonymously, wearily confirmed: \"We do not comment on the content of the meetings, but... the post-meeting cleanup is indeed extremely challenging.\" It is reported that the scene often requires dealing with \"fabrics accidentally damaged during intense discussions\" and \"meeting tools\" of rather suspicious shapes and purposes. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance has received \"emergency office facility replacement requests\" from the official residence for three consecutive quarters, with the most frequently requested items being sofas and mattresses.\nFinance Minister Yamabuki Sae scratched her head and explained during a financial hearing: \"The President and her colleagues are always full of... uh... 'vitality' when discussing state affairs.\" Her somewhat embarrassed yet forcibly composed expression was interpreted by the media as the \"best annotation.\"\nMeanwhile, in Tokyo's underground doujin market, artistic works depicting the five leaders \"discussing the future in intimate proximity\" have long become the most sought-after collectibles, astounding in their bold details and rich imagination. When a reporter presented an exquisitely printed doujinshi to the Cabinet Secretariat, the Chief Cabinet Secretary responded with only a refined diplomatic phrase: \"The Cabinet has no comment on this matter.\"\nDespite the international discussion, domestic approval ratings in Japan have risen instead of fallen.

Files piled up like mountains on her desk, each concerning the livelihood, finances, or diplomatic treaties of this nascent nation. The scratching sound of pen on paper was the only noise in this vast office.\nUntil another sound joined in without warning—the soft sound of the door being pushed open.\nArisa didn't look up, her tone carrying a hint of annoyance放任 (indulged) by fatigue: \"Another urgent file?

It was a cashmere blanket.\nKasumi walked around to her desk, skillfully unscrewed a thermos, and poured a deep brown, steaming liquid into the cup lid. A rich, sweet aroma instantly filled the air.\n\"It's hot cocoa. I had Sae make it for me in the kitchen, with extra marshmallows,\" Kasumi said, pushing the cup towards her. She笑嘻嘻地 (grinned) and sat on the corner of the desk, legs swinging, completely ignoring how 'inappropriate' this was for a head of state.\nArisa stared at the hot cocoa, the white marshmallows floating on top slowly melting.

It was perfectly warm and intensely sweet, driving away the chill of the deep night and melting her taut nerves.\nShe didn't answer \"okay,\" nor did she say \"no.\" She just leaned back in her chair and gently closed her eyes.\nKasumi knew this was her answer.

Arisa's bedroom was simply furnished, impeccably tidy, with a few heavy political science books still placed on the bedside table.\nArisa sat down on the edge of the bed, massaging her temples wearily, as if the weight of her head was becoming too much to bear. Warm drowsiness enveloped her, but a lingering sense of responsibility prevented her from completely relaxing.\n\"Alright, stop holding on.\"\nKasumi's voice sounded by her ear. She半跪 (knelt) before Arisa, gently undid the top two buttons of Arisa's shirt, and carefully helped her out of the well-tailored suit jacket that symbolized power and responsibility. Her movements were as gentle as handling a priceless treasure.\nArisa didn't resist, just let Kasumi maneuver her like a doll whose clockwork had been removed.\nWhen she was pressed down onto the bed, sinking into the soft, fluffy pillow, she let out a vague murmur. \"You...\"\n\"Me?

She could feel the powerful, even world-shaking strength contained within the person behind her, now收敛起 (retracting) all its edge, transforming only into the warmth encircling her. It was her ultimate security, and also her... most irresistible weakness.\n\"...So heavy,\" Arisa buried her face in the pillow, her voice muffled. \"Move your hand.\"\n\"No,\" Kasumi replied bluntly, holding on even tighter. She found Arisa's hand and intertwined her fingers with hers, locking them together. \"I won't move around if I'm holding this hand. Aren't you tired from signing files all day, Arisa?\"\nThis恰到好处 (perfectly measured) tenderness彻底击溃 (completely shattered) Arisa's last line of defense. Her tense shoulders finally relaxed.

Her countless screams during turbulence have long exhausted the defenders who come to check, and even though they know the President's condition, they strongly request that someone control this great President who叱咤风云 (wields great power) on the ground.\n\nThus, the previously separate offices of Arisa and the President were merged. Perhaps it was the reassurance of having her loved one nearby, or simply not daring to act up in front of Arisa, but she finally quieted down a bit. At the very least, she can now hold the hands of her most beloved person during turbulence."
