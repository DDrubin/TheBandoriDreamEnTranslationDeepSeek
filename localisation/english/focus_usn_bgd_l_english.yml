usnavy.0.o: "God Bless America"
usnavy.0.d: "The Second American Civil War intensifies, and the federal government is on the verge of collapse. Amidst this chaos, the 'US Navy Command', commanded by Admiral Michael Gilday, inheriting the main force of the former US Pacific Fleet, holds firm in Hawaii, becoming a powerful but uncertain isolated force, nominally still loyal to the 'Federation'.\n\nAt this time, the emerging East Asian power—the Free Republic of Japan—is actively constructing its 'Asia-Pacific Free Nations Organization' (APFNO). Prime Minister Ichigaya Arisa personally went to Honolulu to engage in high-stakes negotiations with Admiral Gilday concerning the future of the Pacific. Japan's goal is clear: integrate this powerful naval force into the APFNO system in exchange for the alliance's support for its survival, and use this as a means to intervene in the chaos on the North American continent.\n\nThe negotiations were exceptionally difficult. Ichigaya Arisa demonstrated pragmatism and determination, promising that APFNO would provide strategic shelter, resource supplies, and dispatch peacekeeping forces to assist in 'rebuilding the Federation'. For Gilday, this meant handing over partial command of the fleet to a foreign-led alliance and becoming entangled in the bloody civil war on the mainland, but it might be the only chance to avoid isolation, helplessness, and ultimate destruction.\n\nFinally, after considering the region's future, the fleet's survival, and that complex sentiment towards the idea of the 'United States', a historic consensus was reached. Under the gentle Hawaiian sun, Prime Minister Ichigaya Arisa and Admiral Michael Gilday jointly signed the 'Honolulu Accord'. Its core clauses include:\n1.  Command Integration and Coordinated Operations: The US Navy Command (Hawaii) agrees to integrate its operational command system into the overall framework of APFNO. In matters concerning regional security and mutually agreed peacekeeping operations, the US Navy Command will accept strategic guidance and coordination from the APFNO Joint Command, especially when executing alliance missions.\n\n2.  North American Peacekeeping Operation ('Operation Liberty Vanguard'): APFNO formally commits to forming and dispatching a multinational peacekeeping force to the North American continent. Its objectives are to restore order in key areas, protect critical infrastructure, and provide direct military and logistical support to forces committed to restoring a unified, legitimate federal government.\n\n..."
usnavy.2.t: "Operation Sunset"
usnavy.2.d: "The Asia-Pacific Free Nations Organization (APFNO) Joint Command today issued a solemn announcement, declaring the initiation of the decisive military operation codenamed 'Operation Sunset'. This operation aims to彻底终结 (completely end) the oppressive rule of the pseudo 'APLA Government' on the West Coast of the North American continent, respond to the local populace's deep yearning for freedom and order, and fulfill APFNO's fundamental duties of maintaining regional peace and humanitarianism.\n\nSince APFNO, at the request of the 'US Navy Command' and under the framework of the 'Honolulu Accord', launched the 'Americas Peacekeeping Operation', alliance forces have been committed to restoring basic order in designated areas, protecting civilian lives and property, and creating conditions for establishing a unified, legitimate US government. However, the APLA forces entrenched in California and surrounding areas not only rejected all possibilities for peaceful conflict resolution but also persistently employed extreme violence, brutally suppressing dissent, destroying livelihoods, and launching indiscriminate attacks against APFNO peacekeeping forces. Their actions constitute a severe threat to basic human rights and regional stability.\n\nAPLA's stubborn stance and持续暴行 (ongoing atrocities) have made the goal of achieving peace through limited peacekeeping means impossible. To prevent a prolonged conflict from causing deeper humanitarian disasters for innocent civilians, and to彻底铲除 (thoroughly eradicate) this extremist force threatening the region's future, the APFNO Joint Command, with the unanimous agreement of member states, has authorized the execution of 'Operation Sunset'.\n\n'Operation Sunset' will integrate the land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace operational capabilities of APFNO member states and cooperating forces to implement comprehensive strikes against APLA military targets, command systems, and logistical networks until they completely lose armed resistance capability and their controlled areas are fully liberated.\n\nSimultaneously, we send a message to the people still living under APLA control: the moment of liberation is approaching. Please stay away from military facilities and conflict zones as much as possible and protect your safety. APFNO's goal is to strike the oppressors, not to为难 (trouble) the people. The alliance promises that after military operations conclude, it will全力协助 (fully assist) in local reconstruction and support the establishment of a governance body that truly represents the people's will."
usnavy.2.a: "The haze lingering over the West Coast is about to disperse, the dawn of freedom is imminent."

usnavy.1.t: "APLA's Unconditional Surrender"
usnavy.1.d: "[APFNO Joint Command, Honolulu Time: [GetDateText]]\n\nAfter fierce fighting, 'Operation Sunset' has achieved decisive victory! The Asia-Pacific Free Nations Organization (APFNO) Joint Command today officially announced: under the overwhelming offensive of APFNO forces, the organized resistance of the APLA has completely collapsed. Its remaining leadership today issued an unconditional surrender notice to the APFNO Joint Command via broadcast and in writing.\n\nSince the launch of 'Operation Sunset', the APFNO multinational forces have demonstrated highly coordinated combat capabilities and an indomitable fighting spirit,连续突破 (breaching) multiple APLA defense lines. Following the liberation of Sacramento, APLA's command system彻底崩溃 (completely collapsed), and its top leadership was captured. Facing the hopeless situation of全线溃败 (total rout), severed supplies, and collapsed morale, the surviving APLA commanders ultimately chose to lay down their arms.\n\nAccording to the surrender notice, all resisting APLA武装人员 (armed personnel) are ordered to immediately cease hostilities, surrender on the spot to APFNO forces, and hand over all weapons and equipment. APFNO forces have begun executing surrender procedures,全面接管 (completely taking over) former APLA-controlled areas, disarming remaining forces, and maintaining order.\n\nAn APFNO Joint Command spokesperson stated: 'APLA's surrender marks the end of extremist rule in the West Coast region; this is a significant victory for freedom and order over chaos and oppression. We pay the highest tribute to all APFNO soldiers who made tremendous sacrifices for this victory. The road ahead remains full of challenges. APFNO will immediately focus on stabilizing the situation, providing humanitarian aid, and collaborating with local representatives and trustworthy partners to initiate the reconstruction process,致力于 (committing to) helping the people of California and surrounding areas重新拥抱 (re-embrace) peace, freedom, and prosperity.'\n\nPrime Minister Ichigaya Arisa of the Free Republic of Japan commented upon receiving the news: 'The red sunset has fallen; now is the time to welcome the sunrise of freedom. The road to reconstruction is long, but we will walk it together.'\n\nA chapter filled with fanaticism, violence, and chaos has thus ended. The skies of the West Coast have finally been cleared of the red haze. However, the flames of the Second American Civil War are not yet fully extinguished, and the establishment of a new order remains a arduous task."
usnavy.1.a: "Immediately initiate reconstruction and aid!"

usnavy.7.t: "Mashiro Tried Her Best Today Too"
usnavy.7.d: "According to the innovative guidance from the President's office... uh... full of 'Kira Kira' style, Morfonica's lead singer, Kurata Mashiro, has now光荣就任 (gloriously assumed the post of) APFNO Liaison Special Envoy to the United States. Today marks her first time leaving relatively safe Japan for Hawaii to perform her 'diplomatic debut'.\n\n'U-um... e-everyone... I am... Kurata Mashiro... representing... um... APFNO... we... uh... brought... brought...' (She looks down quickly at her script,似乎看到了什么关键词 (seemingly spotting some keywords)) '...love and peace! And also... butterflies?'\n\n(The台下 (audience) grows even quieter, only the sound of tumbleweed rolling by... oh wait, Hawaii probably doesn't have that much tumbleweed.)\n\nAn APFNO liaison officer nearby, experienced but clearly unprepared for this kind of scene, prompts through gritted teeth in an almost inaudible voice: 'S-special Envoy... please emphasize we are here to restore order and provide aid! Not to hold a concert!'\n\n'Ah! Right, right!' Mashiro seems suddenly awakened, raising her head sharply, her volume increasing slightly: 'We are here to... beat the bad guys! Those... red... uh... APLA? Then... we will give everyone... d-distribute supplies! There's... bread! Canned food! And... clean water! That... if everyone likes it... I, I can also... s-sing a song...?'\n\nSomeone in the audience can't help but laugh, and soon laughter spreads contagiously. A weather-beaten-looking man shouts in a thick accent: 'Hey! Little girl! We确实需要 (really do need) bread and water! As for singing... let's talk after we drive those bastards away!'\n\nThe liaison officer secretly wipes sweat and sends a brief encrypted message to the rear:"
usnavy.7.a: "'...Initial contact with target population completed. Special Envoy's performance... highly individualistic. Recommend... adding humor assessment metrics. Over.'"

usnavy.11.t: "The Pacific Springboard"
usnavy.11.d: "With the completion of the 'Hawaii Forward Base' project, Pearl Harbor and its surrounding facilities have been successfully upgraded into a super forward base for APFNO's Americas peacekeeping operation. Within the harbor, ships from the Free Republic of Japan and various allied nations gather; the once tranquil naval port is now bustling. On the airfields, advanced fighter jets are lined up neatly, takeoffs and landings are incessant on the runways, and the roar of engines foretells the approaching storm.\n\nAdvance personnel from multinational forces are arriving successively, conducting coordinated training and final preparations with the naval officers and soldiers stationed here. Although collisions between different cultures and command systems occasionally produce some 'sparks', integration work is progressing有条不紊 (in an orderly manner) under a common goal. The Joint Command reports sufficient logistical reserves and high troop morale.\n\nIchigaya Arisa listened to the report via encrypted communication and succinctly commented: 'Hawaii, this crossroads of the Pacific, has now become our solid springboard for conveying the resolve for freedom and order. History will remember this moment.'\n\nWith large-scale forces assembled here, the time for the next step draws ever nearer."
usnavy.11.a: "The world holds its breath."

usnavy.12.t: "Landing Zone Under Red Tide Impact"
usnavy.12.d: "Sirens wail, artillery thunders! After hours of intense naval bombardment and airstrikes, the peacekeeping force's vanguard successfully tore open a breach on the California coast; a landing zone is初步建立 (initially established)! However, what greeted us was not empty beaches but the fanatical and不计代价 (no-holds-barred) resistance of the APLA.\nFrom简陋却坚固的 (simple yet sturdy) coastal fortifications to滨海城镇 (seaside towns) reduced to rubble, APLA武装人员 (armed personnel)—both its regular army and coerced or fanatical militias—launch counterattacks using every available means. They shout revolutionary slogans, launch suicidal charges, or conduct cold-blooded sniping and ambushes amidst the ruins. Their resistance has caused unexpected casualties and chaos among the landing forces.\n\nUltimately, relying on overwhelming naval and air support and the英勇奋战 (heroic combat) of the landing force soldiers, we repelled the APLA's first wave of frenzied counterattacks and站稳了脚跟 (secured a foothold). A崭新的 (brand new) APFNO alliance flag rises amidst the smoke, declaring our resolve to exist. Although the beachhead is secured, looking around, traces of battle are everywhere; the air is filled with the smell of gunpowder, blood, and the salty tang of seawater.\n\nThe urgent report from the frontline commander is concise: 'Landing successful, but at a heavy cost. APLA's will to resist and tactics far exceeded expectations. The beachhead随时可能面临 (could face large-scale counterattacks at any time); reinforcements urgently needed! Prepare for brutal urban warfare and持续的游击骚扰 (ongoing guerrilla harassment).'"
usnavy.12.a: "Press the attack fiercely, widen the breach!"

usnavy.15.t: "Voice of Hope, Shortwave Broadcast!"
usnavy.15.d: "Inside a high-tech broadcasting facility in Hawaii, Morfonica faces their most peculiar 'performance' to date—executing the cultural psychological operation codenamed 'Daylight'. The mission is to use an ultra-high-power shortwave radio to transmit their music and 'message of hope' to California, controlled by the APLA, intending to break the enemy's morale.\n\nThe atmosphere in the control room is微妙微妙 (subtly tense). Mashiro Kurata nervously clutches her script. Tōko Kiritani is full of curiosity about the shiny equipment: 'Can this connect to my SNS?' Nanami Hiromachi helplessly pulls her back: 'We're here on a mission, not to livestream. Speaking of which, does anyone actually listen to shortwave broadcasts?' Chiyu Futaba looks serious: 'This is a glorious mission! Show some spirit!' Rui Yashio calmly tunes her instrument: 'Technically feasible. The effect depends on the receiving equipment and... the listeners' taste.'\n\nRecording begins. The music of 'Daylight -デイライト-' fills the room. Rui's violin is elegant and resolute, Chiyu's drumming precise and powerful, Nanami's bass stable, Tōko's guitar华丽华丽 (gorgeous/flamboyant). Mashiro's singing, though slightly trembling, is filled with sincere emotion.\n\nAfter the song ends, it's time to read the script. 'T-to the friends in California...' Mashiro tries to sound official, 'We are Morfonica of the APFNO... P-please don't give up hope! Just like... sunlight always breaks through the clouds... butterflies always find flowers... Please believe that freedom's...' She stumbles.\n\nThe liaison officer next to her hurriedly shows a cue card: 'The light of freedom will eventually shine upon California again! The APFNO is with you!'\n\n'...Yes! The light of freedom... will eventually...' Mashiro pauses, then adds seriously, '...and also, I hope everyone can... have enough to eat. Yeah!'\n\nSilence falls in the control room, followed by suppressed laughter. Nanami mutters quietly: 'Well, at least she didn't mention snacks this time...'\n\nFinally, this 'cultural bomb'—a mix of激昂激昂 (rousing) music, official slogans, and Mashiro's unique ending—is encoded, amplified, and transmitted through the massive antenna. Carrying the girls'歌声歌声 (singing/songs/voices) and the complex expectations of the APFNO high command, it flies towards the fog-shrouded west coast of North America. Its actual effect? No one knows."
usnavy.15.a: "This plan... is definitely Kasumi's idea."

usnavy.16.t: "Boarding Day"
usnavy.16.d: "Pearl Harbor's docks resemble a giant kicked-over toy box, filled with the noise of steel, the smell of diesel, and commands shouted in various languages. And at the center of this bustle, docked like a steel island, is the behemoth temporarily transferred to APFNO command and coordination under the Honolulu Accord—the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. Today, this giant ship, a symbol of the old era's power, is about to set sail, carrying the vanguard of the 'APFNO Americas Peacekeeping Force' towards the waters off California.\n\nAnd within this 'peacekeeping force,' five particularly conspicuous figures are mixed in—Morfonica. Under orders from Tokyo, penned by President Kasumi Toyama herself, they are to board the ship with the first wave of troops as 'Cultural Exchange and Battlefield Psychological Intervention Advisors' (a title that sounds utterly unreliable from the start).\n\n'Wow! A moving fortress!' Tōko breaks the silence first, her eyes shining, 'Nanami, quick, find me a good angle for a photo!'\nNanami sighs, habitually checking her phone: 'Nimitz-class, 100,000-ton displacement... Tōko, we're here to work, not sightsee.'\n'P-please maintain silence everyone! Pay attention to your appearance and demeanor!' Chiyu tries to muster her class president authority, though her own legs are shaking from nervousness, and she struggles to straighten her obviously ill-fitting khaki jacket with the APFNO-APK Advisor armband, 'We represent the Republic's image! Be professional advisors!'\nMashiro tightly grips Rui Yashio's sleeve, asking quietly, 'Y-Yashio-san... is it... scary up there? Like... are there eagles?'\nRui calmly observes the massive gangway and busy ground crew, replying flatly, 'According to data, noise on the flight deck during operations can exceed 130 decibels, equivalent to a jet engine taking off at close range. Protective ear muffs are recommended. Also, Mashiro, those are fighter jets, not eagles.' She pauses, then adds, 'Of course, the symbol of the US Navy is indeed an eagle.'\n\nLed by a slightly stiff-faced naval guide, this probably least advisor-like advisor group in history clumsily ascends the gangway leading to the carrier. Along the way, busy soldiers and naval personnel cast curious, puzzled, and even somewhat sympathetic glances their way."
usnavy.16.a: "'Peacekeeping' Advisors on an Aircraft Carrier?"

usnavy.17.t: "Osprey Turbulence"
usnavy.17.d: "If boarding the Eisenhower was like闯入闯入 (breaking into/entering the lair of) a steel beast, then riding in the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft now feels like being stuffed into a giant metal can that's shaking疯狂疯狂 (like crazy/frantically) and might fall apart at any moment. The tremendous noise and intense vibration during vertical takeoff from the carrier deck had already made the five 'advisors' lose their composure. And when the Osprey's two massive rotors tilted forward, switching from helicopter mode to airplane mode, the sudden tilt and sensation of weightlessness caused a small uproar.\n\n'Kyaaaaa—!' Mashiro紧闭双眼紧闭双眼 (squeezes her eyes shut), her face pale as she death-grips the armrests, feeling like her soul and the butterflies have flown out the window, 'A-are we falling?!'\n\n'Calm down, Mashiro! This is normal operation!' Chiyu tries to stay calm, but her tense body and slightly trembling voice betray her, 'This is... uh... part of tactical maneuverability! We are APFNO advisors, we m-must adapt!'\n\n'Cool—! Feels like a roller coaster!' Tōko's initial excitement is soon replaced by the monotonous noise and constant bumping. Now she's trying hard to see the scenery below through the small window, 'Hey, are those houses down there... a bit crooked? Were they hit?'\n\n'Highly likely.' Rui's voice is unusually calm amidst the great noise; she seems more interested in the aircraft's operation itself, 'The V-22's design is indeed unique, combining the advantages of vertical takeoff/landing and high-speed flight, but at the cost of complex mechanical structure and... a less than comfortable ride.' She glances at the green-faced Mashiro, 'Noise primarily comes from the rotors and engines, turbulence is due to low-altitude air currents and the airframe's aerodynamic characteristics...'\n\n'Yashio-san... now is not the time for a science lesson...' Nanami leans weakly against the seatback, holding a small airsickness bag just in case, 'I just want to know... how much longer? I feel my breakfast is... conducting a strategic relocation...'\n\nAfter不知不知 (who knows how long) bumping around in this 'aerial tractor,' the airframe tilts again, the engine and rotor noise patterns change, and the Osprey begins to slow and descend. The scenery outside the window gradually clears, revealing APFNO vehicles, temporary barracks, and a fluttering alliance flag on the ground. With one last heavy thud, the V-22 finally lands safely.\n\nThe door opens, and California's sunlight and air,略带尘土味略带尘土味 (slightly dusty), rush in. The five girls, supporting each other (except perhaps Rui, who might still be analyzing the landing impact), stumble out of the plane and set foot on North American soil. This is the rear area under the 'peacekeeping force's' control,暂时远离前线暂时远离前线 (temporarily far from the front lines), but the air似乎仍能嗅到一丝似乎仍能嗅到一丝 (still seems to carry a hint of) the lingering气息气息 (aura/smell) of war. Their 'advisor' work is finally about to begin formally on this land—"
usnavy.17.a: "Provided they recover from airsickness first."

usnavy.18.t: "Screen War"
usnavy.18.d: "Who would have thought that one day they'd be 'watching' a siege battle from inside a Type 16 Maneuver Combat Vehicle编号为编号为 (numbered) 'Sakura 07'? The interior of this advanced wheeled armored fighting vehicle isn't spacious, but right now it feels like a moving high-tech cocoon enveloping the five 'advisors' of Morfonica. The vehicle vibrates slightly from the distant artillery echoes, but inside, the dominant senses are the low hum of electronic equipment and—screens铺天盖地铺天盖地 (covering the sky and earth / everywhere).\n\nOn the tactical map, blue arrows representing APFNO forces are slowly encircling a red polygon marking an APLA stronghold; real-time footage from drones circles high above, occasionally showing模糊的火光和烟柱模糊的火光和烟柱 (blurry flashes of light and plumes of smoke); the data link constantly refreshes streams of information: IFF signals, ammunition status, friendly positions... For the band members, this is no less than an information deluge冲击冲击 (impact/shock).\n\n'Whoa! This is more exciting than gaming!' Tōko almost presses her face against a screen showing the drone feed, 'See that red dot! Did we hit it? Cool!'\n\n'Tōko! Be serious!' Chiyu frowns, trying hard to understand the complex symbols on the main tactical map, 'We are here to observe and learn! To understand... uh... the importance of combined arms operations!' She turns to the young, utterly expressionless APFNO vehicle commander (who is also their minder for the day), 'Excuse me, what does that flashing triangle mean? Is it... a rare drop?'\n\nCommander (questioning his life choices for the Nth time today): '...That's an enemy anti-aircraft indicator, Miss Advisor.'\n\n'A-anti-air...' Vocalist Mashiro Kurata turns pale, silently shifting her gaze from the main screen to a secondary screen displaying vehicle status (fuel, temp, etc.), seemingly finding those numbers more reassuring.\n\n'But these moving icons, each one represents... people, right?' Bassist Nanami Hiromachi says softly, watching a blue square disappear on the map followed by a casualty report prompt, her expression复杂复杂 (complex/troubled), 'On the screen... it seems so unreal.'\n\nJust then, success indicators密集地闪烁起来密集地闪烁起来 (flash densely) on the main screen, and the distant explosions seem to grow more沉闷而连贯沉闷而连贯 (muffled and continuous). The commander says安慰性安慰性 (comfortingly, or perhaps just to end this mission sooner), 'Looks like the attack worked, the outer defense line has been breached. This observation phase is concluding.'"
usnavy.18.a: "The so-called 'advisors' seem more... surreal than they imagined."

Chiyu Futaba, behind the wheel of this Type 16 Maneuver Combat Vehicle (which is far too large for her), asks不安地问不安地问 (uneasily). They were supposed to be conducting a simple battlefield environment observation in a designated area, but as a result...\n\n'Theoretically optimal path, incorporating terrain avoidance and shortest distance algorithms,' Rui Yashio, in the co-pilot/'technical director' seat, replies calmly, her fingers still swiping on the screen in front of her, 'And the scenery here... is relatively open.'\n\n'Open enough to see the dust rising on the horizon!' Tōko exclaims excitedly from the back, leaning against the observation port, 'Is that our troops? Looks like a lot of vehicles!'\n\n'W-wait a minute...' Nanami Hiromachi, who had been intently watching the main tactical map, says, her voice suddenly changing tone, 'Those... aren't our blue icons! They're all... red! They're... they're surrounding us!'\n\nOn the map, the lone blue vehicle icon representing 'Sakura 07' is being rapidly encircled by a tide of red 'APLA' icons, forming a standard,绝望的绝望的 (hopeless) encirclement.\n\nChaos instantly erupts inside the vehicle.\n\n'Wahhhh! W-we're surrounded! I knew it!' Mashiro Kurata wails, almost shrinking under her seat, 'W-what do we do? We'll become butterflies... no, we'll become dumpling filling!'\n\n'C-calm! Everyone calm down!' Chiyu tries to steady the wheel and her own voice, with little success, 'According to... according to the manual! We should... should activate the smoke dischargers! Which button is the smoke...?'\n\n'How about this red one? It looks powerful!' Tōko reaches out to press a large emergency button.\n\n'Don't touch that! That's the fire suppression system!' Nanami grabs her hand while trying to call headquarters on the complex comms panel, 'Calling 'Starlight' Base! This is Sakura 07! We... we seem to have a bit of trouble! Repeat, major trouble!'\n\n'According to the data,' Rui maintains惊人的冷静惊人的冷静 (astonishing calm), pointing to a data stream on the screen, 'Enemy火力密度火力密度 (firepower density) is increasing. Recommend immediately activating all electronic countermeasures and寻找防御薄弱点寻找防御薄弱点 (seeking a point of weak defense) for an... uh, attempted breakout. Success rate... below 7%.'\n\n'7%?! We might as well sing to them and see if we can convert them!' Tōko shouts despairingly.\n\n'Shut up, Tōko! Yashio-san! Which direction is weakest?' Chiyu is on the verge of tears.\n\n'Southwest, there's a small path, but the terrain... may not be suitable for this vehicle,' Rui answers precisely.\n\n'Never mind that! Charge!' Chiyu yanks the steering wheel hard. The十几吨重十几吨重 (dozen-plus ton) steel beast lurches in a clumsy and悲壮的悲壮的 (tragic-heroic) manner towards that slim 7% hope, or更可能更可能 (more likely), a dead end. Inside, screams, commands (chaotic), prayers (mostly from Mashiro), and Rui's calm data commentary blend perfectly into a...末日摇滚末日摇滚 (apocalypse rock song)."

usnavy.20.t: "Miraculous Breakout"
usnavy.20.d: "The Type 16 Maneuver Combat Vehicle 'Sakura 07' is currently racing down some unnamed California path with an engine sound近乎悲鸣近乎悲鸣 (approaching a wail) and the clattering of what sounds like loose parts. The scene inside can only be described as '劫后余生劫后余生 (after surviving a disaster).'\n\n'W-we... made it out?' Mashiro asks in a tearful voice, cautiously peeking out from under her seat, tear stains still on her face, 'N-no more red dots? On the map... no more red dots!'\n\nIndeed, on the tactical map, the red encirclement that had tightly trapped them is now far behind. How did they break out? No one can say for sure. Perhaps Chiyu Futaba's panicked yank on the wheel恰好撞进恰好撞进 (just happened to crash into) a gap in the APLA's defenses? Perhaps桐谷透子桐谷透子 (Tōko Kiritani)'s desperate shout into the comms意外干扰意外干扰 (accidentally jammed) the enemy's频道频道 (channels)? Or perhaps八潮瑠唯八潮瑠唯 (Rui Yashio) managed to overclock the vehicle's electronic warfare system at the last moment, creating a few seconds of confusion? Or simply... dumb luck of epic proportions?\n\n'Ha! I knew I could do it!' Chiyu pants from the driver's seat, announcing with forced calm, though her hands on the wheel are still shaking, 'See that! A perfect... uh... tactical withdrawal!'\n\n'Yeah, yeah, perfect enough to almost turn all five of us into 'limited edition commemorative pancakes,'' Bassist Nanami Hiromachi吐槽吐槽 (quips/mutters) weakly while checking the scattered杂物杂物 (debris/misc items) inside the vehicle (including a few bags of chips burst from the pressure), 'Rui, vehicle status? I feel like it could fall apart any second.'\n\n'External armor has multiple scratches and minor dents. Left rear tire疑似被弹片击中疑似被弹片击中 (suspected hit by shrapnel) but not leaking yet. Smoke dischargers... inventory zero. Electronic countermeasures module requires reboot.' Violinist Rui Yashio's voice is, as always, calm. She operates the control panel rapidly, 'Overall... still operational. Our survival probability has significantly increased from 7% to... well, within safe zone parameters.'\n\n'Sniff...太好了太好了 (that's great)...' Mashiro finally relaxes completely and starts sobbing quietly,一边哭一边摸一边哭一边摸 (crying while patting) the interior wall, 'Thank you, tanky...'\n\n'Hehe, I told you we're the best 'advisors'!' Tōko has already regained her energy and is even rummaging for snacks, 'When we get back, we gotta celebrate properly! And give this 'lucky tank' a special Morfonica paint job!'\n\nOnly Nanami, looking at the war-scarred scenery flying past outside, sighs silently and starts thinking about how to write the 'Bizarre Breakout Incident Report' to make it sound... less like a tall tale.\n\nIn the distance, the outline of the APFNO-controlled zone appears on the horizon. These five butterflies thrown into the battlefield by fate (and possibly a slightly unhinged command) have actually奇迹般地飞了出来奇迹般地飞了出来 (miraculously flown out) from the claws of the eagle and the red tide's encirclement."

usnavy.21.d: "In the old city hall of a 'liberated' Californian city, the newly established 'APFNO West Coast Provisional Administrative Committee' welcomes its最高领导最高领导 (supreme leader)—Chairwoman Chiyu Futaba. This appointment据说据说 (is said to be the result of) President Kasumi Toyama in Tokyo, while reviewing a stack of documents, casually writing on the back of a Morfonica signed photo 'I believe in you, Futaba-chan! Do your best! ☆'—which the secretariat then took as an official appointment... Regardless, Chairwoman Futaba now throws herself into this brand new, arduous (for everyone involved) job with 120% enthusiasm and sense of responsibility.\n\nHer office (the former mayor's office, with a few可疑的弹孔可疑的弹孔 (suspicious bullet holes) still in the wall) has been rapidly 'Futaba-fied': documents are sorted by color, date, and urgency, labeled neatly with a label maker; the wall sports a meticulously detailed 'Committee Daily Schedule' down to the minute.\n\nToday is the committee's first full (provisional) meeting. Chairwoman Futaba clears her throat, straightens her back, and faces the几位经验丰富但表情复杂的几位经验丰富但表情复杂的 (several experienced but expression-complicated) APFNO administrators, a few bewildered local community representatives, and... for some reason required to attend as observers, the other four members of Morfonica (sitting in a corner,努力憋笑或假装看风景努力憋笑或假装看风景 (struggling to hold back laughter or pretending to look at the scenery)).\n\n'Comrades! Good morning! It is currently 0900 hours California time!' Futaba's voice is loud and充满干劲充满干劲 (full of drive), 'Under the guidance of the President and the lofty goals of the APFNO, this committee's mission is—to restore order! Ensure livelihoods! Advance reconstruction! To efficiently achieve these goals, I have formulated a detailed 'West Coast Revival 100-Day Plan.' Please see the large screen... and the hard copies in your hands (28 pages total, please read carefully)!'\n\nShe begins滔滔不绝地讲解起来滔滔不绝地讲解起来 (explaining non-stop) using the PPT and the huge schedule on the wall, covering everything from 'street cleaning' to an 'essential supplies allocation lottery system based on need,' to 'weekly goal review meetings'... The level of detail is enough to make seasoned bureaucrats头皮发麻头皮发麻 (feel their scalps tingle / be daunted).\n\n'...Therefore,' she concludes with a gesture, 'As long as we strictly adhere to the schedule,认真执行规章制度认真执行规章制度 (earnestly execute rules and regulations), and overcome difficulties like we play the drums—find the rhythm, conquer the难点难点 (hard parts)!—California's tomorrow will surely be better! Any questions?'\n\nSilence fills the meeting room. An elderly local gentleman with a goatee hesitantly raises his hand: 'Um... Madam Chairwoman, what you said is all very good... but... the water pipes in our town were blown up last week, and no one has fixed them yet. This is... on which page of your plan?'\n\nFutaba: '...' She flips frantically through the thick plan book, sweat beading on her forehead, 'W-water pipe issue... let me see... it should... should be in 'Emergency Infrastructure Repair Plan B'... Appendix Three... uh...'\n\nWatching their drummer fall into the classic窘境窘境 (predicament) of 'the plan not keeping up with变化变化 (changes/reality),' Tōko Kiritani in the corner finally can't hold back her laughter and is promptly 'killed' by a look from Nanami Hiromachi next to her.\n\nIt seems Chairwoman Futaba's 'metronome-style governance' will require quite a bit of...即兴创作即兴创作 (improvisation) to play a harmonious tune in the soil of California's reality."

Under orders from above (likely another one of Kasumi's whims), they are to personally experience humanitarian aid work, spread the APFNO's 'love and care,' and顺便顺便 (incidentally)... boost their public image.\n\nThe site is piled high with crates bearing the alliance emblem. People queue up waiting to receive them, the atmosphere mixed with expectation, weariness, and a hint of curiosity towards these Asian girls who seem out of place.\n\nThe distribution work begins, and the situation... quickly becomes多姿多彩多姿多彩 (colorful / eventful).\n\n'P-please take this... Wishing you... uh... a pleasant life?' Mashiro bows deeply each time she hands out a box, her voice small. She even tries to quickly draw a small butterfly on the box with a marker, but when催促催促 (urged/hastened) by the next person in line, she almost pokes herself in the face with the pen.\n\n'Hey! Friends! Look at this can! It's super great, right! Smile! Yes, like that!' Tōko treats the distribution like a fan meet-and-greet, chatting with locals in her halting English while handing out supplies, even attempting to juggle the cans to liven things up, nearly dropping one on her foot.\n\n'Tōko! Stop playing! We're short-handed over here!' Nanami is the closest to a 'normal volunteer' on site. She quickly checks lists, distributes supplies, has to分神分神 (split her attention) to drag Tōko back from trying to sneak off and play with children, and simultaneously handles all sorts of questions ('How do you use this?', 'Are there vegetarian options?', 'Can I have an extra can?'). She's so busy her feet don't touch the ground, her sighs frequent.\n\n'Next! Please present your ID and receipt! Maintain one-meter spacing! No crowding!' Futaba, fully equipped (with an armband and a small notebook), tries to maintain order using methods from managing the school club, meticulously enforcing her self-made 'Aid物资领取规范物资领取规范 V1.0' (Aid Material Receiving Regulations V1.0) on the long queue, drawing不少白眼和窃笑不少白眼和窃笑 (many eye-rolls and snickers).\n\nDespite the process being filled with various小混乱小混乱 (small chaos)—misdistributed items, gestures due to language barriers, 'heated debates' between Futaba and queue-cutters, Mashiro nearly being吓哭吓哭 (scared to tears) by an over-enthusiastic hug—the day's aid supplies are eventually distributed,磕磕绊绊地磕磕绊绊地 (bumpily/stumblingly). Watching the crowd disperse under the setting sun, the five girls collapse exhausted onto empty crates, their faces and clothes covered in dust,形象全无形象全无 (image completely gone).\n\n'Feels... more exhausting than three back-to-back live shows...' Tōko says weakly.\n'But... seeing them get the stuff... they seemed happy?' Mashiro adds quietly."

On a temporarily erected podium in front of the State Capitol building, Chiyu Futaba, Chairwoman of the 'West Coast Provisional Administrative Committee,' clears her throat. Facing APFNO officials, multinational force representatives, local collaborators, and some curious onlookers below, she begins the most important public speech since taking office.\n\n'Ahem! Distinguished guests, citizens, good morning!' Futaba's voice, amplified by the microphone, carries a trace of unconcealable nervousness, but more so a sense of responsibility that fills her with near-boiling determination, 'Today, we stand here not only to celebrate... uh, the阶段性胜利阶段性胜利 (phase victory) militarily, but also to declare—a new California, one belonging to peace, order, and... uh, efficient management, is coming!'\n\nShe tries to project政治家般的沉稳政治家般的沉稳 (statesman-like steadiness), but her occasional glances down at her speech notes and the frequent班长式发言班长式发言 (class-president-like remarks) such as 'Everyone must maintain order' and 'The reconstruction work schedule has been distributed, all departments must strictly implement it' draw微妙微妙 (subtly wry) smiles from some in the audience. Tōko Kiritani elbows Nanami Hiromachi in the corner: 'See, I told you she'd treat the city hall like the student council office.' Nanami can only reply with a helpless 'shush' gesture.\n\nAfter the speech (long-winded but充满激情充满激情 (full of passion)) concludes, accompanied by military music, the highly anticipated (perhaps mainly by Tōko) 'APFNO Peacekeeping Force Joint Military Parade' begins.\n\nLeading the way are the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's proud Type 10 main battle tanks, sleek and with barrels held high; followed closely by Australian LAV series wheeled armored vehicles, appearing agile and swift; then come the US military's M1A2 Abrams and M2A3 Bradley fighting vehicles, integrated under the Honolulu Accord and repainted with APFNO markings,厚重而充满力量厚重而充满力量 (massive and full of power); even equipment from other alliance member states (like South Korea's K21 IFV?) can be seen... This steel torrent cobbled together from various nations' equipment rolls majestically through the streets of Sacramento, a scene both壮观壮观 (magnificent) and imbued with a strange 'world's fair' vibe.\n\nThe parade ends, the sun still shining brightly. The first page of the new order is officially turned amidst the slightly surreal speech, parade, and the girls'议论声议论声 (discussions/chatter). As for what story will be written on this page... only heaven knows."

But in Chairwoman Tsukushi's office, which increasingly resembles a high school club room, the atmosphere is tense again—a meeting on the next strategic plan is underway. On screen are a radiant KASUMI and... a somewhat tired ARISA.\n\n'Tsukushi-chan! Everyone! The work in California has been so wonderful! Sparkly!' Kasumi waves energetically, 'So, next, we must bring this KirakiraDokidoki to all of America! I looked at the map, so many places need our light! Which direction do we go first?'\n\nBefore Tsukushi can pull out her prepared 'Inland Expansion Strategic Plan PPT,' ARISA on the other side of the screen sighs, rubbing her temples, and cuts to the chase: 'Kasumi, before shining across America, some trash needs sorting out first. Latest intel report—that 'Nuclear Legion' in the south, a bunch of lunatics who think the world needs an 'atomic flame baptism,' might have gotten their hands on an unknown quantity of dirty bomb materials. In my opinion, priority, I mean highest priority, is to defuse these anti-human time bombs. Otherwise, we might all get 'purified' halfway through our 'shining,' which wouldn't be fun.'\n\n'N-nuclear weapons?!' Chairwoman Tsukushi immediately stands at attention, 'Yes! Prime Minister! I will... will immediately formulate a 'Special Operation Plan for Nuclear Threat Response and Elimination'! Guaranteed foolproof!' She flusters through stacks of documents, trying to find the corresponding blank flowchart template.\n\nThe other Morfonica members listening in the corner react variously.\n\nNANAMI looks worried: 'We have to deal with... lunatics with nukes? This... this is beyond 'peacekeeping,' right?'\n\n'I understand!' Tsukushi suddenly announces loudly, likely强行理解强行理解 (forcibly interpreting) and merging Kasumi's 'shining' with Arisa's 'firefighting,' 'Our next strategy is—'Flame Purification Operation'! We will split our forces into... uh... several routes. One will spread love and peace (and ample supplies) inland, another...嗯... with the speed of lightning stealing a bell... yes, confiscate those broken 'fireworks'! I have already begun drawing up the detailed battle plan! Everyone, please look at version one...'\n\nWatching the 'strategic mind map' displayed by Chairwoman Tsukushi on screen—a mix of butterflies, stars, skulls, and complex arrows—ARISA sighs deeply again, feeling her stomach ache return. Kasumi,在一旁在一旁 (on the side), claps cheerfully without fully understanding but still excited: 'Wow! Sounds amazing! Do your best, Tsukushi-chan!'"

usnavy.6.d: "Encrypted communications from the southern front bring decisive news of victory: after weeks of intense and dangerous fighting, the extreme annihilationist force entrenched in the southern US—the 'Nuclear Legion'—has彻底崩溃彻底崩溃 (completely collapsed) and announced unconditional surrender. Its remnant forces are陆续放下武器陆续放下武器 (progressively laying down their arms) and assembling at locations designated by APFNO forces.\n\nThe key to this victory was a high-risk raid conducted days ago by combined alliance special forces and NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) disposal experts. The operation successfully located and secured the vast majority of known radioactive materials and potential 'dirty bomb' components held by the Nuclear Legion, destroying its final threat. Having lost its 'doomsday weapon' deterrent and with its main leadership eliminated in prior combat, the Nuclear Legion rapidly disintegrated.\n\nThe news reaches Tokyo, and the atmosphere in the Prime Minister's office visibly relaxes. On screen, Prime Minister ICHIGAYA ARISA's tense expression finally softens. She quickly issues orders: 'Confirm all hazardous materials are fully secured. Initiate the highest security level containment and disposal procedures immediately. Transfer the Nuclear Legion's main war criminals to military court. ...Well done. Notify frontline troops to ensure thorough follow-up mopping-up and安抚工作安抚工作 (pacification work). Finally... defused the most dangerous fuse.' She unusually doesn't immediately move to the next agenda item, seeming to need a few seconds to digest the news.\n\nSimultaneously, the President's office is jubilant. President TOYAMA KASUMI, upon hearing the news, immediately jumps up happily from her chair: 'Excellent! Victory! Victory! Those bullies trying to use 'bad fireworks' are finished! I knew everyone could do it! Arisa! Tsukushi-chan! We successfully protected everyone's sparkle and safety! Should we have a victory party tonight? We could set off... uh... safe fireworks to celebrate!'\n\nThe恐怖阴影恐怖阴影 (shadow of terror) hanging over the American south has finally dispersed. An极端反人类极端反人类 (extremely anti-human) threat has been removed. Though the cost was high, this is undoubtedly a里程碑里程碑 (landmark) victory in the APFNO intervention, clearing a massive obstacle for后续稳定后续稳定 (subsequent stabilization) of the entire North American continent."

Under the powerful military pressure of APFNO forces, the 'American Constitutional Government,' holed up in the inland regions with Denver as its 'capital,' has officially announced unconditional surrender! Its remaining armed forces will lay down their arms and accept reorganization and disposition by the Asia-Pacific Freedom Nations Organization forces.\n\nAccording to frontline reports, after APFNO armored forces breached the final defenses,兵临城下兵临城下 (reached the city gates) of Denver, and its organized resistance largely collapsed, the Constitutional Government's leadership finally admitted defeat. A surrender document signed by its remnant civilian government has been handed over to the APFNO frontline commander.\n\nThe surrender of the Constitutional Government marks the exit from the historical stage of another major contender attempting to inherit the old US legal tradition since the outbreak of the Second American Civil War. The vast inland areas and their resources have theoretically been incorporated into the sphere of influence of APFNO and its主导下主导下 (led) West Coast Provisional Administrative Committee. The path to unifying America seems... to have cleared another obstacle?\n\nAt the Tokyo Prime Minister's residence, ICHIGAYA ARISA looks at the confirmation message popping up on screen, her expression still calm but her speech slightly faster: 'Confirm the details of the surrender terms. Begin immediately the disarmament and registration of Constitutional Government军队军队 (military forces). Order Tsukushi's committee to prepare to take over Denver and surrounding administration. Assess the integrity of its infrastructure.' For her, this seems like just checking off an item on the to-do list.\n\nThe President's office is again filled with Kasumi-style cheer: 'Wow! They surrendered too! Great! Now we can shine all the way from California to Denver! Can Tsukushi-chan and the others hold a concert in the Rockies? That would be awesome! Hey Arisa, should we send the surrendering people some... um... 'friendship crepes'?'\n\nIn Sacramento, upon receiving the news, Chairwoman Tsukushi immediately pulls out her 'Constitutional Government Controlled Area Integration Plan (Revised V3.0)' and starts assigning tasks to subordinates: 'Excellent! This was within our expectations! Group A负责行政接收负责行政接收 (responsible for administrative takeover), Group B负责物资清点负责物资清点 (responsible for inventorying supplies), Group C... uh...负责组织负责组织 (responsible for organizing) the 'New Life Welcome Party' (special instruction from President Kasumi)...

Its last president signed the surrender documents, ordering all remaining federal forces to cease resistance.\nThe fall of Washington D.C. and the final surrender of the Federal government not only marks the end of the main phase of the Second American Civil War but also symbolizes the complete end of an era. Following the successive defeats of forces like the 'APLA' and the 'Nuclear Legion,' the Federation's surrender means there are no longer any large-scale forces on the US mainland capable of challenging APFNO's dominant position and attempting to maintain the old legal order.\n\nIn the President's office, TOYAMA KASUMI watches all this through the same screen, her hands clasped together, her eyes sparkling with genuine joy: 'Great! Finally! Everyone doesn't have to fight anymore! America can finally become kirakira again, full of music and smiles! Arisa!

Its last organized units have surrendered unconditionally to the APFNO peacekeeping forces; their main leaders were either captured or killed in the final battles.\n\nThe destruction of the 'Patriots' League' is the result of a mopping-up operation codenamed 'Final Freedom,' launched by APFNO after the surrender of the American Federation, rapidly assembling superior forces. Facing a hopeless situation with no external support and complete isolation by APFNO, the Patriots' League's resistance, though一度激烈一度激烈 (intense at one point), ultimately could not be sustained.至此至此 (Thus), since the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, all major armed forces opposing the unification process led by APFNO have been eliminated. The state of large-scale civil war that lasted for years on the North American continent (at least within the former United States本土范围本土范围 (mainland territory)) is officially declared over.\n\nAt the Tokyo Prime Minister's residence, ICHIGAYA ARISA looks at the final confirmed battle report on the screen and slowly closes the file. She turns to the communications officer beside her, her tone calm but brooking no argument: 'Notify all APFNO member states and the American Provisional Administrative Committee: the state of hostile armed conflict is officially over. Initiate Phase One of the 'Post-War Reconstruction and National Normalization Act.' Order all combat troops to transition to order maintenance and reconstruction assistance tasks. Inform Chairwoman Tsukushi it is time to remove the word 'Provisional'.' A trace of barely perceptible exhaustion and relief from卸下千斤重担卸下千斤重担 (lifting a heavy burden) finally shows on the young Prime Minister's face.\n\nThe flames of war have finally been extinguished.

usnavy.24.d: "【Illinois, Chicago Time: [GetDateText]】\n\nThe smoke of battle has not yet fully dissipated, but the needle determining the future fate of the North American continent has quietly pointed to the Windy City, Chicago. In this city symbolizing American industry and transportation, the 'Special Consultative Meeting on the Future Governance Model of America' was grandly convened under the auspices of APFNO (Asia-Pacific Freedom Nations Organization). The meeting was chaired by the Chairwoman of the All-America Provisional Administrative Committee, FUTSUYUI TSUKUSHI, with the three core figures of the Japanese Free Republic—President TOYAMA KASUMI, Prime Minister ICHIGAYA ARISA, and Finance Minister YAMABUKI SAAYA—personally attending as 'Special Advisory Representatives.'\n\nThe atmosphere in the conference hall was凝重凝重 (solemn/grave). Chairwoman Tsukushi announced the start of the meeting in her usual meticulous style and distributed agendas and discussion rules spanning dozens of pages. Then, the discussion moved to the core issue: where will this newly unified land go?\n\nFirst to speak was President Kasumi. For now, she reined in some of her usual exuberance, her expression sincere and earnest: 'Representatives, we have witnessed too much破碎破碎 (breakage/shattering) and sadness in the war. But America, this land, the dream it once had—freedom, equality, and the tripartite democratic system that protects these values—I believe this is still the 'Starlight' worth us pursuing and rebuilding. Let us repair it, perfect it, let the United States be reborn in a stronger姿态姿态 (posture/form) after its trials, and once again become a stage where everyone can shine!' Her voice was filled with the glow of idealism, calling for the restoration of that classic American model.\n\nNext, Prime Minister Ichigaya Arisa冷静冷静 (calmly) proposed a截然不同截然不同 (completely different) plan: 'Kasumi's ideals are moving, but we cannot ignore reality. It was the flaws of the old system and internal contradictions that led to this devastating civil war. Repeating past mistakes is not wise.' She scanned the venue, her gaze sharp, 'I propose establishing a全新的全新的 (brand new) 'Republic of America.' This republic will adopt a more stable, more efficient governance structure, and moreover, it will, by signing a binding 'New Pacific Treaty,' form a close alliance with APFNO to jointly safeguard the security and prosperity of the Pacific Rim. Stability压倒一切压倒一切 (overrides everything). Joining hands with reliable allies is the best way to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.'\n\nSubsequently, Finance Minister Yamabuki Saaya also added her remarks, her views focusing more on the economic aspect: 'Regardless of the最终政体最终政体 (final form of government) chosen, a stable, predictable legal and financial environment is crucial for attracting investment and rebuilding the economy. Deep integration with APFNO's mature economic system will undoubtedly greatly accelerate America's recovery process.' Although her remarks did not explicitly take sides, they objectively provided economic support for Arisa's 'New Republic' proposal.\n\nChairwoman Tsukushi looked at the agenda and announced the start of the discussion phase: '...Now, please discuss the two main proposals above. Please note the speaking time,每人每人 (each person)... uh... five minutes. Timing starts!'\n\nAmerica's future will走向完全不同的方向走向完全不同的方向 (head in completely different directions) based on their choice."

In the conference hall, representatives supporting the 'Revival' (including some American locals nostalgic for the old days) applauded; Kasumi's eyes sparkled with idealism, while Arisa only nodded slightly, her expression unreadable, neither satisfied nor resigned.\n\nThe most logical candidate—the diligent and responsible (even overly so) Chairwoman FUTSUYUI TSUKUSHI—unexpectedly failed to gain sufficient support. Rumor has it that some delegates found her style too 'rigid,'不利于不利于 (not conducive to) the transition period which required 'flexibility and empathy.' This left Tsukushi, who always held herself to perfect standards,罕见地有些失措罕见地有些失措 (rarely somewhat flustered) in her seat.\n\nJust as各方僵持不下各方僵持不下 (a stalemate ensued between various parties), and some even began nominating complex figures from the old era, someone—no one knows who—actually nominated KURATA MASHIRO's name! And amidst the chaos and various strange political calculations (perhaps some thought pushing a 'harmless' foreigner as a temporary puppet would be easier to control?), it passed by a slim majority!\n\n'Eh?! Ch-Chief Executive?! M-me?! No! Absolutely not!' When the result was announced, Mashiro almost burst into tears on the spot, frantically waving her hands trying to refuse this appointment she completely could not comprehend.\n\n'Excellent! Mashi-chan!' Kasumi was actually the first to clap, genuinely thinking this was a choice full of 'poetry' and 'hope.' And Arisa... according to eyewitnesses, her expression at that moment was like watching someone use a priceless antique vase to crack a walnut—a complex look混合混合 (mixing) extreme shock, speechless exasperation, and profound despair for the future.\n\nFinal resolution: The United States of America will be rebuilt under the 'guardianship' of APFNO, with its过渡政府最高行政长官过渡政府最高行政长官 (transitional government's highest chief executive) being KURATA MASHIRO. It was also clarified that the President of the Japanese Free Republic, TOYAMA KASUMI, as the head of APFNO's leading power, is the new United States' final guarantor and source of authority in legal theory, but except in 'extremely紧急情况紧急情况 (emergency situations),' she will basically not directly intervene in the internal affairs of the American continent, fully 'respecting' its reconstruction process.\n\nAnd so, before the entire room (including herself) could fully react, KURATA MASHIRO, this timid, introverted, poetry-and-fantasy-loving band lead singer, was pushed onto the throne of the highest (provisional) chief executive of the North American continent. The path to rebuilding the United States seemed, from the very first step, full of uncertainty and...超展开超展开 (super developments)."

Arisa expressed approval of this result; Kasumi, though slightly遗憾遗憾 (regretful) about not 'reviving the United States,' also expressed support for her partner's decision.\n\nHowever, when it came to selecting the provisional chief executive for the transition period, a戏剧性戏剧性 (dramatic) scene played out again. Although the New Republic line emphasized stability and efficiency, which should have been FUTSUYUI TSUKUSHI's forte, she was again排除排除 (excluded) by some delegates for reasons like 'style too stern' and 'lack of flexibility.' Upon hearing the news, Tsukushi's face instantly turned as pale as an unsaved document.\n\nSubsequently, amidst Kasumi's recommendation that 'Mashi-chan is very gentle and will surely unite everyone,' some delegates seeking a 'harmless symbol,' and Prime Minister Arisa's possible complex calculation of 'choosing the lesser of two evils' (believing Mashiro would be easier to 'guide' than ambitious schemers or the overly rigid Tsukushi), KURATA MASHIRO's name once again miraculously passed!\n\n'M-me... become the Republic's... provisional chief executive?!' Mashiro felt the whole world spinning, almost fainting, 'No! Absolutely not!'\n\nKasumi immediately offered an encouraging hug: 'No problem! I believe in Mashi-chan!' Arisa's expression was complex, seemingly doing高速计算高速计算 (high-speed calculations) on the resources needed to support this 'unexpected' leadership. Finance Minister YAMABUKI SAAYA's frown deepened.\n\nFinal resolution: The Republic of America is established, with KURATA MASHIRO serving as its first provisional chief executive. The Republic becomes a close partner of APFNO through the 'New Pacific Treaty,' with the Japanese President TOYAMA KASUMI holding the highest guardianship in legal theory.\n\nAnd so, the newborn Republic of North America, which should have been more 'controllable,' welcomed a poetry-loving, extremely shy少女领袖少女领袖 (maiden leader).

The core objectives of the agreement are: to guarantee the territorial integrity and internal stability of the Republic of America, prevent the resurgence of any extremist forces or separatist activities, deter potential external threats, and promote deep cooperation between the two nations and the alliance in the field of defense.\n\nKey provisions of the agreement include:\nLong-Term Stationing Rights: APFNO has the right to long-term deployment of considerable land, naval, air, and special operations forces on the North American continent, particularly at strategically significant locations.\nBase Usage Rights: The Republic of America agrees to provide APFNO garrison forces with extensive military base usage rights, including ports, airports, training grounds, and related logistical facilities, and guarantees their freedom of movement.\nJoint Command Structure: Establishment of a joint security command agency led by APFNO, responsible for coordinating garrison operations and cooperation with the Republic's armed forces (to be rebuilt in the future).\nLogistical Support Obligations: The Republic of America commits to providing necessary logistical conveniences and support for APFNO garrison forces.\nAgreement Validity: The agreement's validity is linked to the 'New Pacific Strategic Partnership Treaty' and is subject to periodic review based on the security situation in North America and the Pacific Rim (interpretation rights primarily held by APFNO).\n\nAt the solemn signing ceremony, the signatory for the Republic of America was Provisional Chief Executive KURATA MASHIRO, while the signatory for APFNO was Vice-Commander of the Japanese Ministry of Defense, MINATO YUKINA.\n\nThe signing of this agreement undoubtedly lays a solid legal and military foundation for APFNO's long-term influence on the North American continent and formally establishes the Republic of America's core position as a protected (and constrained) partner within the 'New Pacific Order.' A new era for North America will unfold under the gaze of the APFNO garrison."

usnavy.26.t: "Together for Freedom: Old Partners in a New Era"
usnavy.26.d: "The late spring sunlight洒在洒在 (shines upon) Washington D.C., freshly baptized by war and beginning to焕发生机焕发生机 (regain vitality). Today, a special event aimed at symbolizing the rebirth of the United States of America from its ashes and confirming its new partnership with the Asia-Pacific Freedom Nations Organization is taking place in front of the Capitol building.\n\nThe climax of the event is the planting of a cherry blossom sapling, symbolizing 'Trans-Pacific Friendship and New Life,' by President of the Japanese Free Republic TOYAMA KASUMI and Provisional Chief Executive of the United States of America KURATA MASHIRO. President Kasumi's technique is... quite casual, almost happily 'patting' the soil into place; meanwhile, Mashiro, with prompts from TSUKUSHI beside her, completes her part小心翼翼小心翼翼 (with extreme care), almost holding her breath, fine beads of nervous sweat on her forehead.\n\nThe subsequent speech segment further showcased the unique style of this peculiar 'partnership.'\n\nProvisional Chief Executive KURATA MASHIRO, with the help of a teleprompter, spoke haltingly but sincerely: 'Today... standing here... I represent... the American people who are rebuilding, thanking APFNO friends... for extending a helping hand in the darkest hour. The price of... freedom is heavy, but... the resolve to rebuild our homeland... is even stronger. In the future, the United States of America will... will work together with APFNO partners... for our common... uh... sparkle... no, for our common freedom and peace... effort!'\n\nFollowing that, President KASUMI, in her own unique and infectious manner, delivered an impassioned speech: 'It's so wonderful to see everyone able to come together again! Just like the brightest stars in the night sky need to illuminate each other! America and Japan, and all friends of APFNO, our hearts beat 'dokidoki' together for freedom and dreams! From now on, we are the best partners, singing together, moving forward together, creating a super无敌闪亮亮无敌闪亮亮 (invincibly sparkling) future together! It's a promise!'\n\nThe event concluded with applause and somewhat complex expectations. The road to rebuilding the United States is destined to be long, and how much effect this 'together for freedom' partnership, symbolized by Kasumi's idealism and Mashiro's... well...某种“纯真力量”某种“纯真力量” (certain 'pure power'), will have, and where it will lead America? Only time will tell. At least for today, the sunlight was good, and the cherry blossom sapling was planted."

usnavy.27.t: "The Abacus and the Olive Branch: Saaya's North American Economic Blueprint"
usnavy.27.d: "Though the flames of war have subsided on the North American continent, another war without smoke—or rather, an unprecedented massive project—has just begun. In Finance Minister YAMABUKI SAAYA's office, the lights often burn late into the night. The desk is no longer piled high with sheet music or bread recipes, but with reports on damage assessments for various US states, fiscal shortfalls, resource distribution, labor conditions, and... potential return on investment.\n\nAs the key figure leading economic aid and cooperation with America, Saaya深知这其中的分量深知这其中的分量 (understands the weight of this matter perfectly). This is not only about humanitarian aid and helping an ally rebuild, but also directly concerns the future economic interests and strategic layout of the Japanese Free Republic and indeed the entire APFNO.\n\n'...Preliminary assessment indicates that the funds required to restore infrastructure across the entire US to pre-war levels are astronomical,' Saaya said, her tone steady but carrying a hint of fatigue, pointing at the deficit curve on the screen during a closed-door meeting with Prime Minister ICHIGAYA ARISA and the economic advisory team. 'The first batch of emergency humanitarian aid and financial stabilization funds we provided are in place, but this is merely a drop in the bucket.'\n\nShe switched to the next page, filled with a dense schedule: 'I recommend a trinity model of 'Aid + Investment + Trade' for subsequent assistance. On one hand, continue providing low-interest reconstruction loans and essential material aid to stabilize livelihoods; on the other hand, guide enterprises from our nation and APFNO member states to enter the North American market in an orderly manner, participating in investment and cooperation in areas like infrastructure, energy, and high technology—of course, ensuring a fair business environment and... reasonable return on investment expectations.' She phrased it skillfully, but the core idea was clear: aid is not a free lunch.\n\nRubbing her slightly throbbing temples, Saaya took a deep breath looking at the vast and complex economic blueprint before her. The difficulty factor was exponentially greater compared to calculating the daily income and expenses of a bakery and ensuring the neighborhood had fresh bread. But whether it was supporting a small shopping street or participating in rebuilding the economic order of a continent, that attitude of seriousness, responsibility, and careful calculation was, for YAMABUKI SAAYA, perhaps no different. She picked up her pen and carefully marked the next key node on the grand plan. She said softly to herself:"

usnavy.28.t: "The Echo of Freedom"
usnavy.28.d: "Today, some time has passed since the Chicago Conference decided America's future. On the North American continent, the last traces of gun smoke have long since dissipated. In the California sunlight, against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains, in the revitalized cities of the East Coast, a new order is taking root. Roads are being repaired, schools are reopening, factory chimneys are smoking again.治安巡逻治安巡逻 (Police patrols) maintaining order have become part of the street's normalcy.\n\nIn Washington D.C., in some office, FUTSUYUI TSUKUSHI remains buried under mountains of documents and schedules, her brow furrowed, but her eyes now hold a builder's resolve. Elsewhere, KURATA MASHIRO might be standing by a window, watching children play outside, a pen in her hand, lost in thought—she may still not fully understand the complexities of politics, but she feels a certain long-lost, fragile yet real peace. Perhaps, a new song is brewing in her heart. The other members of Morfonica are also on this land, in their own ways, feeling this hard-won tranquility, contemplating the meaning of their strange journey.\n\nThousands of miles away in Tokyo, the lights in the Prime Minister's residence and the Finance Ministry are still bright. ICHIGAYA ARISA reviews reports on the progress of North American reconstruction, her face impassive, only nodding imperceptibly when certain key metrics are met. 'Order is consolidating, costs are controllable, strategic objectives achieved. Next step...' Her thoughts have already turned to a broader board. YAMABUKI SAAYA is carefully calculating the expected recovery of aid loans and the benefits from new trans-Pacific trade agreements, ensuring every bit of investment yields value. 'The economic cycle is recovering, slowly, but the direction is right.'\n\nAnd in the President's office, TOYAMA KASUMI is watching a video sent from America of children singing at a joint APFNO-local community social event, laughing with exceptional joy: 'Look! Everyone is laughing! Everyone is singing! Our 'KirakiraDokidoki' has truly been passed on! The song of freedom is echoing!'\n\nThis echo might not be quite the same as the sound of freedom under the old Stars and Stripes. Born from war, shaped by power, it intertwines the brilliance of idealism, the calculations of realism, the innocence and courage of young girls, and the resilience of countless ordinary people rebuilding their homes from the ruins. It is complex, perhaps imperfect, carrying the scars of the past and the uncertainties of the future.\n\nBut regardless, a new era has arrived. Freedom is making its echo heard across this continent in a全新的形式全新的形式 (wholly new form), and it will continue to be composed."

She used to be the lead singer of Morfonica who could practically blend into the background, her original life's ambition was simply to live each day quietly. However, she was forcibly thrust onto the international stage by Toyama Kasumi under the premise of 'I believe in you.'\n\nBefore her mission to the US, her greatest diplomatic experience was limited to negotiating rehearsal room usage rights on behalf of her band with other school clubs. Therefore, when appointed, she was utterly bewildered and resigned, yet unable to resist Kasumi's fervently expectant gaze. Thus, with the simple wish that 'things wouldn't get messed up,' she set foot on the American continent.\n\nUnexpectedly,凭借天生诚恳的目光和凭借天生诚恳的目光和 (relying on her innate sincere gaze and) a negotiating style so nervous 'it made the other side soften,' she accidentally became a key figure in mediating between various factions.
