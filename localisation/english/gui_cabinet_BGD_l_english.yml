BGD_change_cabinet: "Politics is a science, it is an art."
BGD_change_cabinet_desc: "One can imagine applying the concept of autonomy to realms beyond politics. When we say a person has the capacity for autonomy, we mean that person can govern themselves. Here, this statement might only be symbolic, because no one can truly suppress themselves, although one might consider their higher faculties suppressing their lower ones, if such a distinction can be discerned. But for every individual, the difference between governing oneself and being governed by others is a matter of paramount importance. Understanding the word autonomy from the perspective of the individual might be the key to explaining the paradox of societal autonomy."
