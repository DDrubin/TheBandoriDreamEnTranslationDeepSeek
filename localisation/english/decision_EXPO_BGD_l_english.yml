decisions_BGD_EXPO: "§OOsaka World Expo 2025§!"
decisions_BGD_EXPO_desc: "How to make Osaka relive the glory of the 1970 Expo has become our top priority. Issues such as whether to attract outside companies for construction, how many resources should be allocated, and cooperation with the Restoration Association (Ishin no Kai) which still controls Osaka Prefecture and Osaka City after the civil war, have become heavy burdens on the shoulders of the young Osaka-Kansai Expo Restoration Minister, Rimi Ushigome.\n\nShe might still feel timid about it, but ultimately, due to a simple desire to do something for her hometown, she mustered her courage and decided to take on this重任 (heavy responsibility). Let's pray for little Rimi that everything goes smoothly......\n\nHint 1: You can choose to start the Expo before the quality reaches 100%, but this will not achieve the perfect ending. Only when both construction progress and engineering quality reach 100% can it be a perfect success.\nHint 2: Time is tight and the task is heavy; you need to constantly monitor and handle the Expo work to complete it successfully!"

BGD_EXPO_rimi_desc: "Everywhere is in萧条 (decline) after the civil war. Relying solely on local efforts can no longer ensure the successful construction of the Expo. We must request aid from the central government to allocate more budget and resources. A young §K Special Appointee§! will also come along......"
BGD_EXPO_Attracting_foreign_companies: "Attract Outside Companies"
BGD_EXPO_Attracting_foreign_companies_desc: "The construction of the Osaka-Kansai Expo was contracted to local Osaka and Kansai businesses, which relates to their local political and commercial interests. However, these businesses can barely take care of themselves after the war, let alone build the Expo properly. If they continue to cling to this piece of fat meat they can't swallow, it will only ruin the Expo. We must attract investment, inviting companies from other domestic and international locations to undertake the construction, with the central government also participating."

BGD_EXPO_Meeting_with_the_Restoration_Party: "Meet with the Osaka Restoration Association"
BGD_EXPO_Meeting_with_the_Restoration_Party_desc: "The Japan Innovation Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai) and its branch, the Osaka Restoration Association (Ōsaka Ishin no Kai), still control Osaka Prefecture and City in the post-war local elections. If we want to smoothly advance the Expo construction, we will have to deal with them. The KiraKiraDokiDoki Party branches in Kansai and Osaka will contact them for talks, and Rimi will personally出面 (step forward) to negotiate terms with them. Of course, considering the Restoration Association itself actively promotes the Expo plan, this meeting shouldn't be too difficult."

BGD_EXPO_Report_to_the_Central_Government_desc: "The central departments主要负责 (primarily responsible) for this Expo are the Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister's office.

BGD_EXPO_Focus_on_build_quality: "Focus on Construction Quality"
BGD_EXPO_Focus_on_build_quality_desc: "Construction has entered the final sprint stage, but due to rushing for success, some laughable quality issues have emerged, such as expensive yet very简陋 (crude) toilets (hard to look at), methane exceedances in some areas, and construction quality problems in certain places. To整治 (rectify) these issues, Minister Rimi will personally step in to ensure the final Osaka-Kansai Expo is presented to visitors with a high-quality appearance."

BGD_EXPO_Final_Promotion_and_Speech_desc: "The Expo construction work is nearing its end, and Rimi's efforts are finally about to pay off. We will promote the good news of the Osaka Expo's imminent completion to the world, attracting tourists from various countries to participate, showcasing the power of global unity in this turbulent era. At the same time, all members of PPP will attend as government officials to give a speech celebrating the achievements of the Expo so far and outlining future prospects. The wrapping-up work will also begin, ensuring no slackness even at the final stage of the project, making the Expo construction as perfect as possible."
BGD_EXPO_Fundraising_Speech: "Organize Fundraising"
BGD_EXPO_Fundraising_Speech_desc: "Although citizens don't have much money soon after the civil war, we still know this Expo is an event that can benefit all citizens. Therefore, we will organize fundraising and encourage people to donate to support the Expo. Donors will then enjoy discounted services at the Expo. This activity will focus mainly on Kansai and Osaka, but fundraising activities will also be carried out nationwide. The targets for donations include not only ordinary citizens but also political and business figures."
