SPACE.0.t: "We choose to go to the moon"
SPACE.0.d: "Members of the Diet, dear citizens:\nToday, I stand here not just as a president speaking, but as a person with dreams, to declare to you—the Free Republic of Japan will advance to the moon!\nWe call it 'Project Romulus'. The goal of this project is, within the next ten years, to bring our nation's probes, our pilots, and even our culture, to this planet that once existed only in poetry and gazing. We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but precisely because it is difficult. It will test our technology, our will, our unity, and our faith.\nThis is not a contest to flaunt power, nor an imitation of past hegemony. It is a declaration—a new nation reborn from the flames of war will explore the frontiers of the universe with peace, cooperation, and creativity.\nGoing to the moon is a leap in science, national confidence, and a cultural cry. We will take art, and the dreams of every citizen, with us into space. We will not just plant a flag in the lunar soil; we will leave the imprint of the human spirit there.\nJust as we defend freedom on Earth, we will also transmit the same light to the cosmos."

SPACE.1: "Lost Child on the Moon"
SPACE.1.d: "\"Ahem... Ladies, gentlemen, and all citizens watching online.\" The scene was a JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) press conference. The spokesperson cleared his throat, trying to maintain composure. Ever since the Kirakira Party came to power, especially with President Toyama Kasumi's enthusiasm for \"KiraKiraDokiDoki\" extending to every level of the nation, JAXA's daily life had become... well... full of \"surprises\".\n\"Today, we are honored to announce the astronaut team selection for 'Project Romulus'—our country's first manned lunar mission.\" The spokesperson paused, took a deep breath, as if the names he was about to read weighed a ton.\n\"After... um... a multi-dimensional comprehensive evaluation, we believe the team that best represents the Free Republic of Japan's spirit of exploration, resilient will, and... unique youth cultural perspective is...\" He pressed the slide button. The screen showed a promotional photo of the band MyGO!!!!! alongside a mock-up of them in spacesuits.\n\"—The team composed of Takamatsu Tomori, Chihaya Anon, Nagasaki Soyo, Kaname Raana, and Shiina Rikki!\"\nThe venue fell into an eerie silence for about five seconds, before erupting into a buzz of discussion, mixed with gasps of disbelief and a few stifled laughs. Reporters frantically clicked their shutters; camera flashes seemed intent on freezing this surreal scene forever.\n\"I know... this may come as a surprise to some.\" The spokesperson continued, forcing calm. \"But the evaluation committee believes that the team's ability to maintain cooperation (?) under... extreme pressure, their experience in dealing with... complex emotional fluctuations (??), and the profound understanding of the themes of 'being lost' and 'searching' (???) displayed in their works make them exceptionally suitable for this journey into the unknown. They will bring a全新的 (brand new)... 'proof of existence' to the moon.\"\nFaint arguing could be heard backstage, but it was quickly drowned out by the noise in the room. A reporter shouted a question: \"May I ask, have they received any aerospace training?!\" The spokesperson wiped his sweat: \"The relevant intensive training program... will commence immediately. We believe in their learning ability and... adaptability.\"\nIn front of a TV, President Toyama Kasumi, who had just signed a document about increasing the budget for stray cat welfare, saw the news and flashed a brilliant smile, nodding vigorously: \"Mhmm! MyGO-chan will definitely find the best 'lost song' on the moon! This is so 'KiraKiraDokiDoki'!\""

SPACE.2: "Lost Child on the Moon"
SPACE.2.d: "Practice at RiNG had just ended, the air still tinged with a hint of awkwardness and fatigue. Chihaya Anon was scrolling through news on her phone, trying to find some light topic to ease the atmosphere.\n\"Wow! Look, look! They announced the astronauts for that 'Project Romulus'!\" Anon's eyes lit up as she held up her phone screen for everyone to see. \"I wonder who the elites will be... Huh?\"\nOn the screen, next to the slightly stiff face of the JAXA spokesperson, was their own band's promotional photo and... a composite image of them in spacesuits?\nChihaya Anon:\n\"Huh? Huh huh huh huh huh—?!\" Anon's smile instantly froze, her eyes wide as saucers, her phone nearly slipping from her hand. \"Wai... wait! Wha-what is this?! A-astronauts?! Us?! To the moon?!\" She looked慌乱 (panicked) at the others, trying to find an answer on their faces that this was a prank, but a corner of her mind was already疯狂计算 (frantically calculating) whether this would be a boost or a毁灭性打击 (disastrous blow) to her popularity plan. \"This... would this make me more popular at school... No! We'll die, right?! We'll absolutely die?!\"\n\"Ha—?!\" Rikki shot up from her drum stool, her drumsticks clattering to the floor. \"What kind of cosmic joke is this?! Did those bureaucrats get hit by a meteor?! Sending us to the moon?!\" She snatched Anon's phone, glaring at the words on the screen, her face pale. \"Forget training, we're not even sure if we can get through next week's live show smoothly! And...\" She turned sharply to look at Takamatsu Tomori, who was shrinking in a corner, her voice rising an octave, \"Sending Tomori to a place like that?! Pitch black and freezing cold vacuum?! Do you want her to die?! Absolutely not!! I'm going to complain!!\"\n\"Moon......?\" Tomori, who already had her head down, seemed to petrify upon hearing the news, her body trembling slightly. She murmured softly,断续地 (haltingly): \"So... far... feel... like I'll get lost... worse than... getting lost on Earth...\" She instinctively shrank further behind Rikki, who seemed the most reliable (or, rather, the best at blocking her), her voice tearful, \"Being... a person... on the moon... would it be... harder...?\"\nAt first, Soyo's face also showed a flash of pure astonishment, but soon, she covered her mouth with her hand, revealing a complex, inscrutable smile somewhere between \"troubled\" and \"thoughtful.\" \"My, my... this is certainly... an unexpected arrangement.\" She gently smoothed her hair, her eyes sweeping over the other members, especially Tomori and Rikki's reactions. Her tone was as gentle as if she were comforting frightened small animals, \"But, if we all go to the moon together... in a way, it means we'll be together 'for a lifetime,' right? At least for the duration of the mission. Hehe...\" But deep within that smile, there seemed to lurk a shadow of \"things have become troublesome again.\"\nRaana, who had been leaning against the wall with her eyes closed as if dozing, was oblivious to the commotion. Hearing the word \"moon,\" she opened one eye a slit, tilted her head, and made a curious, cat-like sound: \"Moon?\" She sat up straight, her gaze sweeping over the noisy members, finally landing on the composite spacesuit image on the phone screen. Her fingers unconsciously mimicked a guitar-playing motion in the air. She suddenly spoke, her voice soft but clear:\n\"Can you... play guitar on the moon?\"\nThen she added:\n\"...Interesting.\"\nThen, as if nothing had happened, she picked up her guitar and lightly plucked a string. For her, whether she could bring her guitar seemed far more important than the moon landing itself.\nThe entire practice room was instantly filled with a mix of chaotic emotions. This \"lost journey on the lunar surface\" seemed destined to be extraordinary from the moment the team was announced."
SPACE.2.o: "??"
SPACE.3: "Kasumi, What Are You Doing"
SPACE.3.d: "\"Excuse me—!\"\nThe heavy office door was thrown open with a bang. The first to charge in was a furious Shiina Rikki, followed by a flustered Chihaya Anon trying to hold her back, then Nagasaki Soyo with a complex expression trying to maintain elegance (?), Takamatsu Tomori shrinking almost into Soyo's shadow, and lastly, Kaname Raana strolling in slowly with her guitar case.\nKasumi looked up. Seeing who it was, her serious expression instantly melted into a big, sunny smile: \"Huh? Everyone's here? Did you come to cheer me on? I was just looking at some super—difficult documents Arisa left!\"\n\"Cheer you on for what! Kasumi! Explain this clearly!\" Rikki completely ignored the office's solemn atmosphere, rushed to the desk in a few strides, and slammed her hands on the桌面 (desktop), making the star-shaped pen holder jump. \"Why us?! To the moon?! Have you been working too hard lately, mixing up national affairs with writing lyrics?!\"\n\"Ri-Rikki-chan! Calm down! This is the President's office...\" Anon whispered a reminder, but she was also extremely nervous, her eyes darting between Kasumi and the military exercise documents. \"Um... Kasumi...? What's with the JAXA press conference? Was it... some kind of mistake?\"\n\"No mistake!\" Kasumi blinked, looking utterly理所当然 (matter-of-fact). \"I think it's a super idea! Think about it, everyone in MyGO!!!!! is always searching for direction while 'lost,' right? So what place could be better for finding the ultimate answer and a 'band for a lifetime' than the vast, unknown universe?\" She said it with utmost sincerity, as if it were obvious logic.\n\"Being... a person... on the moon... would be... more confusing than on Earth...\" Tomori's voice, almost inaudible, came from behind Soyo, tearful. \"And... no air... can't... sing either...\"\n\"Hehe,\" Soyo took a step forward, a perfect social smile on her face, but no trace of amusement in her eyes. \"Kasumi, we are very grateful for your 'profound understanding' of our band's philosophy. However, astronauts require professional training and special qualifications. We... probably don't meet the usual standards, do we?\" Her words, though polite, carried a clear tone of doubt.\n\"Standards are meant to be broken!\" Kasumi clenched her fist, her eyes sparkling with excitement. \"Precisely because you aren't 'usual' astronauts, this exploration is even more meaningful! It represents the spirit of our Republic—ordinary people can also reach for the stars! Your journey itself will be the greatest 'lost song,' bringing hope and a 'KiraKiraDokiDoki' feeling to the whole nation!\"\nRaana walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window, curiously looked at the garden outside, then turned back, looked at Kasumi, pointed to her guitar case, and asked succinctly: \"Moon. Can bring this?\"\Kasumi was stunned for a moment, then nodded vigorously: \"Of course! I already told JAXA to figure out a way! A space concert! Cool, right?!\"\n\"Cool—my foot!\" Rikki was practically going crazy. \"This isn't about being cool! It's about safety! And the budget! Do you know how much money this will cost?! Didn't Saaya throw the budget proposal in your face?!\"\n\"Saaya... well, she did nag for a long time, but she agreed in the end! She said it's a 'strategic cultural investment in the future'!\" Kasumi imitated Yamabuki Saaya's reliable and steady tone, but her face still wore that \"everything will be fine\" optimistic expression. \"Don't worry, safety measures will be top-notch! The training will be fun too! Just think of it as a super—long band training camp!\"\nFaced with this Kasumi who made a moon mission sound as simple as organizing a band trip to the beach, the five members of MyGO!!!!! were momentarily at a loss for where to even begin吐槽 (criticizing/complaining). The stark contrast between Kasumi's serious work attitude (looking at documents) and her惊人的思路 (astonishing thought process) in handling this matter filled the entire质问现场 (confrontation scene) with a sense of脱力系幽默 (exhaustion-type humor)."
SPACE.3.o: "Meow"
SPACE.4: "Spin Spin Spin Spin Spinning~"
SPACE.4.d: "\"So... spinning a few times simulates going to the moon?\" Chihaya Anon's voice sounded muffled inside the sealed centrifuge capsule. She tried to force an \"I'm looking forward to this\" smile, but her twitching嘴角 (corners of her mouth) betrayed her unease. The brand new but old-fashioned orange training suit was tight, making her feel like a sardine stuffed into a can.\n\"Not 'simulate'! Idiot Anon!\" Shiina Rikki snapped irritably. She adjusted her restraints烦躁地 (annoyedly), making sure Tomori next to her was securely fastened. \"This is to get our bodies used to the huge G-forces during launch and re-entry! So we don't turn into mush!\" She glared at the mental image (probably her own creation) of President Kasumi outside the capsule, smiling and waving a little flag (with stars and musical notes) cheering them on, her anger boiling. If it weren't for Kasumi's nonsense about \"this is for the band to gain cosmic inspiration\" and \"going through this together is the best training camp,\" plus JAXA's一堆 (pile of) \"absolutely safe\" guarantees (and possible behind-the-scenes pressure), they would never have agreed to this suicidal training!\n\"It's okay, Tomori-chan.\" Nagasaki Soyo's voice was relatively calm. She reached out and gently patted Tomori's shoulder, though her own breathing rate was faster than usual. She offered a reassuring smile, but her clenched fists and slightly white knuckles revealed she wasn't as calm as she appeared. 'For the sake of a \"lifetime\" band... this level of sacrifice... is necessary... right?' she thought silently, trying to convince herself.\n\"Test beginning! Initial acceleration, 3G!\" A technician's冰冷 (cold) voice came through the communicator.\nThe capsule began to rotate slowly, then faster and faster.\n\"Whoa!\" Anon felt an invisible force pressing her into her seat, her breathing becoming labored. \"This... is way more intense than a roller coaster... but not fun at all!\"\n\"Shut up! Save your energy!\" Rikki yelled, gritting her teeth, feeling the flesh on her cheeks being pulled back.\n\"5G!!\" \"8G!!\"\n\"Feel... like... being stepped on... by a giant...\" Anon managed to utter with difficulty, her vision starting to blur, the surroundings turning gray. She felt her consciousness was about to be甩出去 (flung out).\nRikki felt like a huge rock was pressing on her chest, every breath a struggle. She wanted to turn to check on Tomori, but her neck felt leaden and immobile. She could only hope Tomori was holding on.\nSoyo紧闭双眼 (tightly closed her eyes),努力维持 (trying hard to maintain) abdominal breathing, but the immense pressure stripped away her elegance, fine sweat beading on her forehead. She felt her internal organs sinking.\nRaana's expression changed noticeably for the first time, no longer just curious. She frowned slightly, pursed her lips,似乎极力对抗 (seeming to fight极力 against) the powerful force. Her fingers unconsciously tapped a complex rhythm on her leg, as if using music to对抗物理极限 (combat the physical极限 limit).\n\"10G!!\"\nOnly heavy breathing and suppressed whimpers remained in the capsule. Anon felt she was about to lose consciousness, everything going black. Tomori seemed to have passed out, completely still. Rikki's vision also began to narrow, but she held on stubbornly with sheer force of will. Soyo's body trembled slightly, but she maintained her posture. Raana's eyes were half-open, gaze somewhat涣散 (unfocused), but her finger-tapping hadn't stopped.\n\"Peak reached! 12G! Maintain for 15 seconds!\"\nThose 15 seconds felt like an eternity. Everyone felt their body and soul being torn and crushed. Kasumi's promise of \"KiraKiraDokiDoki\" seemed utterly pale and ridiculous now, leaving only pure physiological agony and fear of the unknown.\nWhen the centrifuge slowly decelerated and finally stopped, the capsule door was quickly opened. Medical personnel rushed in.\nAnon was the first to give in, vomiting violently (fortunately, preparations were made nearby). Rikki gasped for air, immediately挣脱束缚 (breaking free of her restraints) to check on Tomori. Tomori slowly regained consciousness, her eyes空洞 (empty), clearly severely shocked. Soyo leaned back in her chair, face pale, but managed a weak smile: \"See... we... did it...\"\nOnly Raana, after recovering slightly, wiped the cold sweat from her face, looked at the other equally狼狈不堪 (disheveled) members, and said in a somewhat hoarse voice, with a strange sense of回味 (aftertaste):"
SPACE.4.o: "\"...Meow.\""
SPACE.5: "Floating Lost Stars"
SPACE.5.d: "The instructor's沉稳 (steady) voice came through the headset: \"Preparing for first parabola,注意呼吸调整 (pay attention to breathing adjustment)... 3... 2... 1... Begin!\"\nFollowing the change in the aircraft's engine angle came a strange pulling sensation, then the sudden onset of weightlessness! It was as if the floor had instantly vanished; everyone, along with their reluctant moods, floated weightlessly into the air.\n\"Wahhhhh—! Fly, flying!\" Chihaya Anon let out a cry mixed with delight and fright. She flailed her arms like a duckling thrown into water discovering it could float, trying to \"swim\" through the air. Miscalculating her strength, she bumped headfirst into the padded wall opposite and bounced gently back. \"Oww... dizzy... but so fun!\"\nThey were inside a specially modified aircraft undergoing so-called \"parabolic flight\" training. The aircraft climbs at a steep angle, then reduces thrust at the apex, following a parabolic trajectory down. During this, the cabin experiences about 20-30 seconds of weightlessness. For astronauts (candidates?) needing to adapt to microgravity, this is a crucial ground simulation.\n\"Fly your head! Stop moving! Be careful of Tomori!\" Shiina Rikki's voice came through the comms, full of anger and worry. She was also weightless but tried to stabilize herself, reaching out to grab Tomori, who was floating like a leaf, only to send herself spinning instead. \"Dammit! This is impossible to control! Hey! You instructors! What if Tomori gets scared?!\"\n\"So... scary...\" Tomori's voice was tearful, almost drowned out by the engine's hum. She felt all her gravity disappear, as if thrown into a boundless, icy void,随时会被黑暗吞噬 (about to be swallowed by darkness at any moment). \"Let me... down... I want... solid ground...\" Her quiet sobs came clearly through everyone's headsets, making Rikki even more anxious.\n\"Everyone calm down, relax your bodies as per the training manual, use the walls for minor attitude adjustments.\" Nagasaki Soyo's voice tried to maintain its usual calm and gentleness, but a slight tremble at the end betrayed her discomfort. She attempted a seemingly composed floating posture, but her body slowly, uncontrollably, began to spin. Seeing Tomori's state, she also wanted to move closer to comfort her but found even keeping facing the same direction exceptionally difficult. \"Tomori-chan, don't be afraid, look, we're all here...\" Her words were interrupted as she accidentally bumped into the cabin ceiling, cracking her perfect facade slightly.\nIn this small, chaotic universe, Raana stood out格格不入 (as not fitting in). Weightlessness didn't seem to affect her negatively; instead, she found it新奇 (novel). She didn't struggle or panic, but舒展四肢 (stretched her limbs) like a jellyfish, letting herself float. She curiously watched her teammates' various狼狈 (awkward) postures, tilted her head to look at the rapidly flipping sky and earth outside the window, her eyes闪烁 (shimmering) with an indescribable light. She even reached out and gently touched a drop of water (sweat or tears?) floating nearby, watching it break on her fingertip.\n\"Preparing to level out! Brace for impact!\" The instructor's voice rang out again.\nWeightlessness vanished abruptly, replaced by a brief period of超重感 (increased G-force), pressing everyone back onto the floor (padded mats).\n\"Ugh...\" Anon was the first to rush toward the prepared vomit bags.\n\"Tomori!\" Rikki scrambled over to Tomori's side and紧紧抱住 (hugged her tightly).\nSoyo leaned against the wall,脸色有些苍白 (face somewhat pale), but still努力维持着微笑 (trying hard to maintain a smile), politely telling the inquiring instructor she \"felt fine, just needed to adapt.\"\nOnly Raana, sitting cross-legged on the mat, looked up at the space where she had just floated, and whispered to herself in a voice only she could hear, with a sense of回味 (aftertaste) and a peculiar excitement:\n\"...Body, disappeared. Sound... seems... clearer...\"\nThen, she looked up at her green-faced teammates and added, as if it were very important:\n\"...Just now, like a cat.\"\nEveryone:"
SPACE.5.o: "\"…………？？？\""
SPACE.6: "Song of Ice and Fire - Act I: Frigid Hell (-40°C)"
SPACE.6.d: "\"So... so cold... fingers... going to freeze off...\" Chihaya Anon's voice was tearful, her teeth chattering. She tucked her hands into her sleeves,整个人像只受冻的鹌鹑 (her whole person like a freezing quail), constantly stomping her feet. \"My skin is going to crack! This damn place doesn't even give us hand warmers! That idiot Kasumi—! When I get out, I'll make her treat us to the finest yakiniku!!\"\n\"Shut up! So noisy! Save your heat!\" Shiina Rikki scolded, but her own face was bluish from the cold, her nose tip red. She pressed her body as close as possible to Takamatsu Tomori, trying to share some warmth, while glaring恶狠狠地 (venomously) at the expressionless technicians outside the observation window. \"Hey! Had enough of watching?! Tomori's about to collapse! If this continues, she'll get sick!\"\nTakamatsu Tomori could barely form complete sentences, just unconsciously shrinking closer to Rikki, her body shaking like a leaf in the wind. \"Cold... voice... frozen solid...\" Her breath formed white puffs in front of her,仿佛要把她和这个冰冷的世界隔离开 (as if trying to separate her from this icy world).\n\"Everyone... try to keep moving, promote blood circulation.\" Nagasaki Soyo's voice was relatively steady, but her constant rubbing of her arms and slightly purple lips revealed her true state. She tried to recall polar survival技巧 (techniques) from books, but her mind was only filled with \"so cold\" and \"want hot black tea.\" \"Perhaps... we could... huddle together for warmth?\" she suggested, a seemingly reasonable but slightly awkward proposal given the group's dynamics.\nKaname Raana seemed to have a strange tolerance for the cold, or perhaps her focus was entirely elsewhere. She crouched on the ground, curiously watching the frost rapidly forming on the floor, even reaching out to touch it with a finger before quickly pulling it back, her face showing an expression similar to \"being burned.\" \"...Ice, bites.\" she said quietly, then buried her face in her knees and said no more, only occasionally shuddering."
SPACE.6.o: "Act II"
SPACE.7: "Song of Ice and Fire - Scorching Purgatory (+50°C, High Humidity)"
SPACE.7.d: "The environment changed abruptly, the chill instantly replaced by a suffocating wave of heat. The frost on the walls melted rapidly, the air becoming damp and sticky. The five had long since been ordered to change out of their heavy training suits and were now wearing thin gray shorts and T-shirts, but sweat soaked through their clothes almost immediately.\n\"Ah—! So hot! Melting!\" Anon瘫坐在地上 (slumped on the ground), fanning herself desperately with her hand, but only hot air blew. \"My hair is sticking to my face... image completely ruined... this is a hundred times worse than handing out flyers under the summer sun!\"\n\"Shut up! Will being quiet make it cooler?!\" Rikki wiped the sweat from her forehead, which immediately trickled back down, stinging her eyes. She looked焦躁地 (anxiously) at Tomori, whose cheeks were unusually flushed, breathing rapid, eyes somewhat涣散 (unfocused), looking like heatstroke was imminent. \"Hey! Water for her! And cooling patches! Hear me?!\" she roared towards the observation window.\n\"So... dizzy...\" Tomori leaned against the corner, voice weak,整个人像是脱水的植物 (her whole person like a dehydrated plant), wilted. \"Air... so heavy... like... a wet quilt...\" She felt her consciousness growing模糊不清 (blurry) in the stifling heat.\n\"Everyone, remember to hydrate... though there doesn't seem to be any water here.\" Soyo努力维持着仪态 (tried hard to maintain her composure), but sweat still trickled down her neck. She took out a spare small towel (produced from who knows where) and dabbed gently, her eyes scanning the cabin as if searching for even a hint of coolness. \"Stay calm... the more agitated you are, the higher your body temperature...\" she said softly to herself and the others, but it had little effect.\nRaana's performance was again surprising. She seemed unusually tolerant of the heat as well, or perhaps she had found a unique way to cope. She sat motionless in a corner's shadow (though the shadow was also scorching hot), eyes closed as if meditating. Sweat dripped from her chin, but her expression was异常平静 (exceptionally calm). After a long time, she slowly opened her eyes, looked up at the glaring lights above, and said in an almost inaudible voice:\n\"...Sweat... is salty. Like... the sea.\""
SPACE.7.o: "Training End"
SPACE.8: "Song of Ice and Fire - Training End"
SPACE.8.d: "When the cabin door finally opened, letting in normal-temperature air, the five almost tumbled out. Anon rushed to the water cooler first and gulped down water. Rikki supported a swaying Tomori. Soyo, assisted by staff, sat on a chair, face pale, and requested a cup of... iced herbal tea.\nRaana was the last to emerge. She shook her wet hair, looked back at the metal room that had just subjected them to the extremes of ice and fire, her eyes not showing fear but rather a trace of若有所思 (thoughtfulness). She walked over to Rikki, poked Tomori's sweaty forehead, and said quietly:\n\"Just now... felt like being boiled. And frozen.\" She paused, then added"
SPACE.8.o: "\"...Both sounds, not good to hear.\""
SPACE.9: "A Gentle Push..."

SPACE.9.d: "\"Left lateral correction... excessive! Excessive! Anon, steer a bit to the right! No no no, the joystick! Not your head!\" The instructor's voice was full of exhaustion over the comms channel.\nChihaya Anon sat in the simulator cockpit, her palms sweaty, faced with a dazzling array of instrument panels and the docking target (a massive image of a space station). \"I-I know! But it won't listen to me! It's like when a drummer rushes the beat sometimes!\" She shoved the joystick forward violently; the ship on the screen lurched sideways, crashing into the edge of the space station. A piercing alarm sounded, the screen turned red, displaying \"DOCKING FAILURE - STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.\"\n\"Wah! S-Sorry!\" Anon shrank her neck in fear.\nIn the adjacent simulator, Rikki was running an emergency obstacle avoidance procedure. She slapped the control panel irritably: \"What's with this crap reaction speed?! I pressed it! Why won't it dodge?! This is harder than getting *someone* to come to practice on time!\" On her screen, the ship she piloted successfully dodged a large asteroid, only to slam headfirst into a small one.\nSoyo was the only one who barely managed to complete a slow-speed docking procedure, but it took three times the standard time. When she exited the simulator, she wore a perfect smile, but her clenched fists and slightly pale complexion said it all.\nRan wore a massive VR helmet, her view showing the exterior of the simulated space station and a large robotic arm. Her task was to use the control stick to precisely grab a floating experimental module and install it in a designated location. However…\n\"Ran, please pay attention to your operational precision. Avoid unnecessary large swings,\" the instructor's voice came through the comms, tinged with helplessness. On the screen, the huge robotic arm was performing a kind of… indescribable dance in space, following the peculiar movements of the control stick in Ran's hands. It swung rapidly at times, jerked to a sudden halt at others, as if playing some complex rock drum beat, completely ignoring the target module right in front of it.\n\"This… feel…\" Ran muttered to herself, completely immersed in her own world, \"Drumsticks… too heavy…\" She seemed to be treating the control stick like a drumstick or a guitar pick, trying to \"play\" it. As for that experimental module? It had already been accidentally \"swatted\" far away into the distance of the simulated view by the robotic arm."
SPACE.9.o: "Don't actually get lost in space…"
SPACE.10: "Calculation of a Miracle"
SPACE.10.d: "Tension filled the simulator cabin. This was a crucial part of the \"Romulus Plan\" training: simulating the transition from Earth parking orbit to lunar transfer orbit, with fuel consumption strictly within critical limits. Previous attempts had all ended in failure.\n\"Dammit! Only 15% fuel left!\" Shina Rikki stared intently at the data, sweating profusely. \"Another 0.5-second error, and we'll drift away lost!\"\n\"C-calm down, Rikki-chan…\" Chihaya Anon said tremulously, trying to recall the formula for the gravitational slingshot effect, but her mind went blank.\n\"No time! The window is only 30 seconds left!\" Nagasaki Soyo pulled up auxiliary data. \"We need to fine-tune the ignition vector, but this is beyond our training scope.\"\n\"Are we… going to crash into a star?\" Takamatsu Tomori asked softly, watching the approaching orbital intersection.\nThen, the silent Ran opened her eyes, tilting her head as if listening to the engine and alarm sounds.\n\"……Too fast,\" she murmured.\n\"Hah? What's too fast?\" Rikki snapped angrily.\n\"The rhythm, it's off.\" Ran pointed at the parameter display. \"Here needs to be slower… like a rest note.\" Then she pointed at the main engine thrust: \"Here needs a 'crescendo', but 'staccato'… one, then another.\" Her words were full of musical metaphors.\nRikki was about to retort but found that these adjustments based on \"random tunes\" and \"guitar strings\" surprisingly matched the vague calculations in her own mind that she hadn't had time to verify?!\n\"Let's gamble on it!\" Rikki operated decisively. \"Thrust adjustment -5%… yaw angle +0.8 degrees…\"\nSoyo immediately followed: \"Pitch angle synchronous fine adjustment -0.2 degrees!\"\nAnon stared intently at the remaining fuel, while Tomori clasped her hands and closed her eyes in prayer.\nThe engine roared one last time and then fell silent. The cabin was utterly quiet.\nA green prompt popped up on the main screen: \"ORBITAL INJECTION SUCCESSFUL. REMAINING FUEL: 2.1%.\"\n\"S-succeeded?!\" Anon exclaimed in shock.\nSoyo slumped into her chair, letting out a long sigh of relief.\nRikki looked at Ran's seemingly asleep face, snorted complexly, and allowed a slight upward quirk at the corner of her mouth.\nTomori opened her eyes, saw the green prompt, and said softly, \"Great…\"\nIn the observation room, JAXA personnel were dumbfounded, replaying the operation logs repeatedly, trying to comprehend the miracle of this \"stroke of genius.\"\n\"That engine sound just now…\" Ran slowly spoke again, \"…was like a good bass line.\"\nAlthough the process was chaotic and almost mystical, this miraculous operation gave JAXA a completely new understanding of their potential (or unpredictability)."

SPACE.11: "Heartbeats Beneath the Launch Tower"
SPACE.11.d: "The 'Freedom I' rocket stood like a silver-white giant tower against the night sky. Inside the command module at its tip, the five girls waited with bated breath. The cabin was filled with the smell of antiseptic, the low hum of electronics, and the restless beating of their hearts.\n\"Countdown… T-minus 30 minutes…\" The calm announcement from ground control hammered at their nerves with every word.\n\"In… out…\" Chihaya Anon tried to relax, her heart drumming like thunder. Gazing at the Earth outside the viewport, she murmured, \"We're really… leaving… It's like a dream.\" She whispered, \"Did I update my social media? Everyone will watch the livestream, right?\"\n\"Stop胡思乱想 (húsīluànxiǎng - overthinking/letting your mind wander)! Check the readings!\" Shina Rikki suppressed her own tension, staring at the instrument panel to verify data, occasionally glancing at Takamatsu Tomori. Seeing her expression was relatively calm, she relaxed slightly. \"Tomori, how do you feel?\"\n\"……The rocket is 'breathing',\" Tomori looked into the void, listening to the faint vibrations of the fuel system. \"Like a very big… very heavy heartbeat.\" Her voice was light and distant, as if already connecting with the universe they were about to embark towards.\n\"It's okay, we'll face it together,\" Nagasaki Soyo said gently, but her tightly clasped fingers betrayed her inner turmoil. She looked out the viewport at the starry sky. \"This is probably… our 'lifetime' band's most special performance together… although, the instruments are a bit strange.\"\nRaana was the calmest, leaning back in her seat, her fingers tapping a slow rhythm on her leg, as if providing a silent accompaniment to the unknown.\n\"T-minus 15 minutes. System status green.\" The control center announced again.\nA brief silence fell in the cabin, filled only by breathing and machine sounds.\n\"Um… if we don't come back… my figurines…\" Anon whispered.\n\"Shut up! Don't say things like that!\" Rikki interrupted.\n\"I will… miss convenience store rice balls…\" Tomori said softly.\n\"Heh, the moon… probably doesn't have matcha,\" Soyo said with a bitter smile.\nRan remained silent, but the rhythm of her tapping subtly quickened.\nThe low rumble of the rocket intertwined with fear, dreams, and unfulfilled wishes. These five girls were being pushed towards the unknown universe.\nThey didn't know what awaited them, nor how music and fate would change, but at this moment, they were closely connected, waiting for the command that would ignite the night sky.\n\"T-minus 1 minute. Entering final launch sequence.\"\nHeartbeats, suddenly accelerated.\nThe cosmic movement belonging to MyGO!!!!!"

The ground lights vanished in an instant, clouds rushed upwards wildly.\n\"Aaaaaah——!!!\" Anon screamed, her voice swallowed. Her internal organs seemed to churn, eyeballs pressed, vision darkening.\n\"Hold on! Keep breathing!\" Rikki gritted her teeth, forcing her thoughts to stabilize amidst the violent shaking, preparing to monitor the booster separation.\nTomori curled up trembling, but remained silent. Outside the viewport, the blue sky turned indigo, finally becoming a sky full of starlight.\nSoyo barely maintained consciousness, sweat plastered to her forehead. \"Atmosphere… about to… exit…\" she murmured.\nRan was surprisingly calm. Though breathing was difficult, her gaze was bright. Watching the fiery clouds and stars outside the window, she seemed to be listening to the symphony of the universe, her fingers silently keeping time.\nMinutes felt like centuries.\nSuddenly, the violent shaking ceased.\n\"Boosters successfully separated!\" Rikki's voice was hoarse.\nThe main engines cut off. Silence fell instantly.\nThe crushing pressure disappeared. Weightlessness arrived. Their bodies floated lightly.\n\"Weigh… weightless?\" Anon opened her eyes, watching beads of sweat float in the air. \"We… succeeded?\"\n\"Orbit confirmed… speed 7.9 kilometers per second… altitude 215 kilometers.\" Rikki's voice held disbelief. \"We… are in near-Earth orbit.\"\nOutside the window, the blue edge of the Earth was dreamlike.\nTomori looked up at the starry sea, her voice trembling. \"……The stars… are so… close…\"\nSoyo sighed softly. \"So beautiful…\"\nRan secretly loosened her restraints, slowly floated up, reached a hand towards the stars, and murmured to herself:\n\"……Silent.

But under the dual influence of low gravity and the bulky spacesuit, this simple action became extremely difficult. She managed to insert the pole a little, but as soon as she let go, it tilted crookedly. \"Ah! No no! It has to be straight! This represents the nation's image!\" She tried to straighten the pole, lost her footing, and nearly did a \"lunar faceplant,\" only stabilizing herself by grabbing the pole just in time. \"That was close… almost became the first astronaut to trip on the moon…\"\n\"Anon! Stop playing! Come help!\" Shina Rikki's voice came from not far away, full of impatience. She was struggling to assemble a tripod-structured scientific instrument; the precision parts were extremely difficult to handle with thick gloves. \"This damn frame! The designer definitely never came to the moon themselves! The latches are too tight!\"\nExperiment Two:\nLunar Dust Dynamics… and Accidental Dust Kicking\nAnon finally (crookedly) got the flag planted and received a new task: use a small shovel to collect lunar soil samples and place them into sample bags.\n\"This is easy!\" Anon thought this task was simpler than planting the flag. Mimicking her training, she dug the shovel in… and then flung it upwards with too much force!\nIn one-sixth gravity, the loose lunar dust flew up like fireworks, forming a small grey \"cloud,\" shimmering in the sunlight.\n\"Wow! It's flying!\" Anon found the sight novel and couldn't help but fling a few more shovelfuls, having fun. \"Look! Even the dust on the moon dances!\"\n\"Anon! You idiot!!\" Rikki's voice was practically explosive. \"That lunar dust will stick to the spacesuits! It will damage the equipment! And it will get brought back into the lander! How many times did the manual emphasize that?! Are you a goldfish?! Seven-second memory?!\" The flying dust partly drifted towards the instrument Rikki was calibrating, making her even more furious.\n\"S-sorry!\" Anon finally realized her mistake and stopped, looking手足无措 (shǒuzúwúcuò -不知所措 bùzhīsuǒcuò - at a loss) at the grey powder now coating her spacesuit.\n\"Alright, alright, stop arguing…\" The voice of Soyo, who had been silently observing via comms, chimed in适时 (shìshí - timely/appropriately), trying to diffuse the situation. \"The experimental data… well… looks… very 'characteristic'. Pay attention to safety and complete the tasks quickly to return to the lander.\" Her tone carried a hint of barely perceptible fatigue and helplessness.\nRaana's voice also chimed in unusually, seemingly summarizing the various \"noises\" just heard: \"……Tapping rocks… kicking up dust… arguing… mhm… new… noise material.\"\nThis lunar surface \"scientific experiment\" was full of各种意想不到的状况 (gè zhǒng yìxiǎngbùdào de zhuàngkuàng - all sorts of unexpected situations) and MyGO!!!!!-style chaos.

After comms were restored, Rikki reported with all her strength before slumping into her seat. The violent impact and the rocking of the waves made the five, who had just experienced re-entry, feel nauseous.\n'Rocking... rocking so hard... dizzier than the centrifuge...' Anon's face was pale, her hand covering her mouth. 'I never want to be on a boat again... wait, a spaceship...'\n'Like... a giant... cradle...'

The hatch opened, the scent of the ocean washing over them as medical and technical personnel quickly approached.\nIn the medical bay aboard the 'Izumo', the five changed out of their heavy spacesuits into blue flight suits and underwent comprehensive check-ups. Though exhausted, mildly dehydrated, and suffering from muscle soreness, their overall health was good.\n'Ugh... finally can take a shower...' Anon was almost crying with joy.\nRikki, after confirming Tomori was safe, fell asleep immediately.\nSoyo politely answered the doctor's questions, her expression distant, clearly in need of rest.\nTomori sipped replenishment fluids quietly, gazing at the ceiling.\nRaana remarked 'Interesting' about the medical equipment and asked the doctor if she could record the beeping sounds."

SPACE.23: "'Surprise' Reunion"
SPACE.23.d: "Days later, in Tokyo, a grand press conference was held as scheduled. Camera flashes were like daylight, countless reporters and cameras focused on the podium. MyGO!!!!! members, wearing well-fitted dark blue uniforms (more formal than flight suits) adorned with JAXA and Republic insignia, sat behind a long table, facing the world's gaze. They looked much recovered, but a trace of fatigue and discomfort with such occasions was still难以完全掩饰 (difficult to completely hide) on their faces.\nHalfway through the conference, the host激动地宣布 (excitedly announced): 'Now, let's give the warmest applause to welcome the President of the Free Republic of Japan, and the staunchest advocate of the 'Romulus Plan'—Toyama Kasumi!'\nAmid thunderous applause, Toyama Kasumi, wearing her signature brilliant smile and a well-tailored dark blue suit (much more formal than her usual stage outfits, but still with a shiny star brooch pinned to the collar), walked energetically onto the stage.\n'Everyone from MyGO!!!!! Welcome home! You are the heroes of the Republic! Your courage and spirit of exploration have lit up the entire nation, bringing infinite 'Kira Kira Doki Doki'!' Kasumi walked among the five, enthusiastically hugging each one (some noticeably stiffened), then raised the hands of the nearest Anon and Rikki high, flashing a standard smile for the cameras.\nHowever, the expressions of the five, praised by the President as 'heroes', were微妙 (subtle):\nAnon: Struggling to put on a professional smile, but her eyes were somewhat wandering, seemingly thinking 'Kasumi hugged me! This will definitely get me more followers... right? But I really want to吐槽 (complain/roast) her for sending us out to suffer waaaah!'\nRikki: Frowning deeply, corners of her mouth turned down. If looks could kill, Kasumi's back would probably be riddled with holes. She was barely suppressing the urge to pull her hand back and demand of Kasumi 'Do you know how many times we almost died out there?!'\nTomori: Slightly lowering her head, somewhat at a loss, startled by Kasumi's enthusiasm, muttering softly '...So noisy... like... during launch...'\nSoyo: Wearing a perfect, impeccable social smile, but deep in her eyes hid a hint of 'Heh, finally back. Perhaps it's time to settle some accounts.'\nRaana: Expressionlessly looked at Kasumi, then at the dense crowd and camera flashes below, seemingly judging which side's 'noise' was more interesting.\nReporters疯狂提问 (frantically asked questions), while Kasumi happily supplemented and 'answered抢先 (answered抢先 -抢先 means抢先, so 'jumped in to answer')', turning a serious results debrief into something resembling a fan meet-and-greet.\nWhen a reporter asked about their biggest收获 (gain) on the Moon:\nAnon: 'Saw a super—beautiful Earth!'\nRikki: 'Came back alive.'\nTomori: 'The moon... was very quiet...'\nSoyo: 'Proved the possibility of teamwork... even under extremely difficult circumstances.'\nRaana: '...Recorded... new sounds.'\nAnd when asked what they most wanted to do now, the five (except perhaps Raana, who might be out of the loop) all glanced,微妙地 (subtly) and unanimously, towards Kasumi, who was still滔滔不绝 (chattering away)描绘着 (depicting) the 'Cosmic KiraKira Grand Adventure'. Their facial expressions varied, but their inner thoughts seemed surprisingly consistent—\n(Internal OS: I really want to press this culprit to the ground and make her experience the 12G centrifuge / parabolic flight vomit套餐 (combo) / re-entry atmospheric barbecue / lunar dust in the face feeling waaaah!!!)\nOf course, this could only remain a thought. In front of countless cameras, they were still the Republic's 'space heroes', the Stray Stars who completed an impossible mission. As for all the accumulated resentment and吐槽 (complaints/roasts), they would probably have to save it for私下里 (in private), using their most擅长的方式 (skilled method)—music (or something else)—to have a good 'exchange' with this 'Kira Kira President'.\nThis喧嚣的 (boisterous) press conference marked the official conclusion of MyGO!!!!!'s lunar journey, and also foreshadowed the beginning of a new chapter of life filled with 'noise' and turbulence upon their return to Earth."
