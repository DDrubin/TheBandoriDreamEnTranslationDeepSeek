desc_slogan_first: "\"Boundaries never end; they are merely redefined.\"\n\n20th-century wars tore the earth apart and demarcated borders.\nAs the dawn of the 21st century shines, humanity turns its gaze to the stars above.\n\nEarth is merely the prologue, orbit is the frontline, the Moon is the outpost, and Mars, Jupiter... are the next frontiers.\n\n\n\nSteel remains, ambition endures—the next campaign belongs to the stars."

desc_first_main: "After the Japanese Free Republic emerged from the ruins of civil war and re-established an order of democracy and freedom, President TOYAMA KASUMI solemnly announced to the Diet and the world: Japan will return to space and complete its first lunar landing within three years.\nThis exciting plan, codenamed 'Romulus'—named after one of the twin brothers from ancient legend who founded Rome—symbolizes the courage and ambition to move from the edge of civilization to the stars.\nThe Romulus Plan is not just a scientific feat; it is a cultural leap.\nIt proclaims an idea: even a nation built by idealists is qualified to embark on a journey between the stars and the moon.\nThe plan is led by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), with the joint participation of member states of the Asia-Pacific Freedom Nations Organization."
desc_first_sgp_base: "To enhance launch efficiency and space mission execution flexibility, the Asian Freedom Nations Alliance decided to establish a new multi-functional space center near the equator in Singapore. This center is named SASH (Southeast Asian Space Hub) and includes vertical/horizontal launch facilities, spacecraft assembly centers, mission control rooms, research institutions, and an international cooperation base. The rotational acceleration advantage provided by its equatorial location will significantly reduce rocket fuel requirements and effectively improve the execution capability of large missions."
desc_first_rocket: "The technical core of Phase One of the Romulus Plan is the FREE-01 heavy rocket (Free Republic Explorer Engine-01). This rocket model is designed to deliver over 190 tons of payload into low Earth orbit,具备月球轨道注入与深空任务能力具备月球轨道注入与深空任务能力 (possessing lunar orbit injection and deep space mission capabilities).\n\nThe FREE series rocket adopts a segmented modular configuration, offering high scalability and future重组兼容潜力重组兼容潜力 (reconfiguration compatibility potential). The engine section is jointly developed by JAXA and APFNO, using liquid oxygen-methane propellant, combining reusability and environmental friendliness, marking a major breakthrough for Asia in green aerospace propulsion technology."
desc_deltav: "In space, unlike driving on Earth where air resistance and friction help you slow down, and there's no steering wheel to easily change direction (turning also requires power), spacecraft (like rockets, satellites) must rely on consuming fuel and jet propulsion to accelerate, decelerate, or change flight direction.\n\nWhen we say a rocket has 9000 m/s of Δv, it means it can accelerate (or decelerate) by a total of 9000 meters per second.\n\nCompleting tasks in space, for example:\nLaunch from Earth: ≈ 9500 m/s Δv\nEarth orbit to Lunar orbit: ≈ 4100 m/s Δv\nLanding on Mars: ≈ 5500~6000 m/s Δv\nIf you don't carry enough fuel, meaning your Delta-V is insufficient, you won't reach your destination, even if you 'seem close.'\n\nEvery time a rocket accelerates, it consumes fuel, which makes the entire vessel 'lighter.'\nSo, the lighter you become later on, the more acceleration you can generate with less fuel.\nBut the problem is: you have to carry all the fuel from the start, so more fuel means a heavier rocket, making it反而越难加速反而越难加速 (harder to accelerate)—this is the so-called 'rocket mass paradox.'\n\nDelta-V is like your spacecraft's 'Mana Points (MP)'; you use it for various actions. Not enough fuel, and you can't go anywhere.\n\nIn summary: You need to always pay attention to your Δv, and be careful not to become a permanent satellite of Earth."
