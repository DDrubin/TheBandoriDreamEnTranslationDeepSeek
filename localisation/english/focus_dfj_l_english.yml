JDF_renmin_zhisheng: "The People's Victory"
JDF_renmin_zhisheng_desc: "We—the People's Coalition—have defeated the Liberal Democratic Party and won this crucial general election that determines Japan's destiny. The world situation is at a critical juncture; we must not辜负 (betray) the expectations of the Japanese people and must fulfill the promises made to the people during the election."
JDF_chengnuo_heping: "Promise Peace"
JDF_chengnuo_heping_desc: "Conflict has been constant around the world, but recently there is a risk of escalation, especially with the United States陷入巨大危机 (mired in a huge crisis). Our country has深刻体会过 (deeply experienced) the cruelty of war and must never drag its people into another war. We will solemnly promise the people that we will absolutely not interfere in any conflict or war."
JDF_duihua_huanhe: "Détente with China"
JDF_duihua_huanhe_desc: "China is a neighbor that has a巨大的 (tremendous) influence on us; this will not change, regardless of whether various domestic political forces within our country hold positive or negative attitudes towards it.\n\nRelations with China may determine whether our country can have peace in the future, especially now with the Taiwan Strait crisis on the brink of eruption. Moreover... using the Chinese people's own saying, this is their内政 (internal affair). Interfering in the Taiwan Strait would touch China's底线 (bottom line). We cannot risk starting a war with the Chinese dragon over a small island. We must sign important political and diplomatic treaties with China, jointly声明 (declare) adherence to the One-China principle, and demonstrate to the people our firm resolve for peace. The right wing will surely be dissatisfied with this, but it is a crucial step."
JDF_qianghua_zuoyi: "Strengthen the Left Wing"
JDF_qianghua_zuoyi_desc: "Since our election, the domestic left wing has been greatly encouraged; movements are蓬勃发展 (flourishing), especially within universities and the education system where left-wing forces are extremely active. Let us relax the past suppression policies against the civilian left wing and support their activities."
JDF_jiaoyv_gaige: "Education Reform"
JDF_jiaoyv_gaige_desc: "The fundamental method to ensure the right wing has no place in our country's future is to start with education. Children are the future. Only by teaching them the correct content in textbooks can society develop a trend of thought that reflects on our country's past war crimes and opposes war. Only then can future Japan be free from the poison of ultra-right-wing and militarist ideology. We will initiate education reform, particularly in history education."
JDF_wuzhuang_zhongli: "Armed Neutrality"
JDF_wuzhuang_zhongli_desc: "If a conflict truly breaks out in East Asia—most likely in the Taiwan Strait region—Japan must strictly adhere to a policy of armed neutrality, ensuring its own national defense security while not aiding any party involved. We must absolutely not allow the flames of war to reach here. Obviously, the right wing will erupt in protest again."
JDF_shehui_gongping: "Social Equity"
JDF_shehui_gongping_desc: "Our society is far from reaching a level where everyone can live happily. The people have given so much; don't they even have the right to live a little better?\n\nExpanding social security, building a more完善的 (comprehensive) welfare system, and lifting up those struggling people forgotten in the corners of society—these are just small first steps. Solving poverty is not that easy, but we will firmly take steps to promote socially equitable development."
JDF_kangji_youyi: "Resist the Right Wing"
JDF_kangji_youyi_desc: "Recent reforms and foreign policies have undoubtedly angered the right wing. Their propaganda trucks are everywhere in the cities, and various protest activities are频繁出现 (frequently appearing). They want to destroy these achievements; we must absolutely not allow it. Increase efforts to crack down on right-wing activities, restrict their mobilization, and launch a propaganda war. We will utilize every measure available to counter the right wing.\n\nHowever, internal voices warn that we have gone too far, that the People's Coalition has leaned left too severely. Some parties are already clamoring to withdraw, and many party members are expressing dissatisfaction...... But now there is no turning back; only forward movement remains."
JDF_chongshen_lichang: "Reaffirm Stance"
JDF_chongshen_lichang_desc: "East Asia is no longer peaceful; China has launched an attack against the Taiwan regime, vowing to reunify the motherland. No matter how the far-right incites and advocates, we must absolutely not follow their wishes and drag the Japanese people into a bloody war. We will reaffirm our stance, adhere to the policy of armed neutrality, not interfere in this war, and not support any party involved. Japan will forever be peaceful!"
